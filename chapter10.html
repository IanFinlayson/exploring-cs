<h2>10.1 Storing Lots of Variables</h2>
<hr />

<p>Imagine that we were writing a program where we wanted to store a large
amount of data.  For example, imagine we were writing a program to figure
calculate your grade in a class.  We might want to store all of our grades
into the program.  Let's say we have 10 quiz grades in the class.  We might
write code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
quiz1 = 88
quiz2 = 94
quiz3 = 76
quiz4 = 100
quiz5 = 92
quiz6 = 89
quiz7 = 95
quiz8 = 85
quiz9 = 79
quiz10 = 99
</code></pre>

<p>Then we might want to add up all of these grades to figure out
our average:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
total = quiz1 + quiz2 + quiz3 + quiz4 + quiz5 + quiz6 + quiz7 + quiz8 + quiz9 + quiz10
average = total / 10
</code></pre>

<p>This hopefully seems a little bit tedious and repetitive.  We have to make
10 different variables and do the same thing with all of them.  Here, it's not
<em>too</em> bad with 10.  But imagine if we had even more numbers we wanted to keep
track.  For instance, imagine you <em>teaching</em> a course and wanted to store
all 10 quiz grades from 25 students.  That would be a lot of variables!</p>

<p>There is a better way of doing this which is to use a <strong>list</strong>.
A list is a collection of multiple pieces of data that are stored together
in one variable.</p>


<h2>10.2 Creating Lists</h2>
<hr />

<p>To create a list, we can put the values in the list between square brackets,
separated by commas.  For example, we can store our 10 quiz grades in a list
like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
quizzes = [88, 94, 76, 100, 92, 89, 95, 85, 79, 99]
</code></pre>

<p>We could also create a list of strings:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
names = ["Bob", "Alice", "Joe", "Mary"]
</code></pre>

<p>Or a list of graphical objects like lines:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *
lines = [Line(Point(0, 0), Point(0, 10)),
         Line(Point(10, 0), Point(10, 10)),
         Line(Point(20, 0), Point(20, 10)),
         Line(Point(30, 0), Point(30, 10))]
</code></pre>

<p>Each of these lists stores <em>all</em> of the values inside them.
Lists provide a convenient way to store a bunch of things together with
one name to access them.</p>



<h2>10.3 Accessing List Elements</h2>
<hr />

<p>Once we have created a list, we can access each thing in the list.  To do
this, we can use the position of each element we want to access.</p>

<p>Like strings, the first thing in the list is at position 0.  The second
element is at position 1, and so on.  Starting at position 1 is a common
mistake in programming.</p>

<p>In order to access an element, we use the name of the list, then the
position inside of brackets.  So to access the first quiz grade in the above list,
we would use:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print(quizzes[0])
</code></pre>

<p>To access the last name above, we can say:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print(names[3])
</code></pre>

<p>When we use the position number to access the things inside of a list, we
say that we are <em>indexing</em> the list.</p>

<p>If we use an index that is too big for our list, Python will give us an
error message:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(names[4])
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;pyshell#1&gt;", line 1, in <module>
    print(names[4])
IndexError: list index out of range
</code></pre>


<h2>10.4 Example: Dates</h2>
<hr />

<p>Let's say we want to write a program that converts a numerical date into one
using words for the month.  For example, we can put in 3 for the month and 25
for the day and it will print out "March 25".  We could do it with if
statements like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
if month == 1:
    print("January", day)
elif month == 2:
    print("February", day)
elif month == 3:
    print("March", day)
# and so on...
</code></pre>

<p>This can actually be done with less code (and more efficiently) using lists.
We can make a list of all the month names.  We could then <em>index</em> the list
with the month number.  We will have to subtract 1 from the index because month
numbers start at 1, but list numbers start at 0.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# get our input
month = int(input("What is the month? "))
day = int(input("What is the day? "))

# make a list of all the names of months
names = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
         "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]

# get the name of this month by indexing
monthName = names[month - 1]

# print our output
print("It is", monthName, day)
</code></pre>

<p>This program works by taking in the month as a number.  It then subtracts
one from this number and uses it to index the list.  So if the month number is 5,
it subtracts 1 to get 4.  It then uses 4 as the index to get the name "May" out
of the list.</p>

<p>Below is an example of this program running:</p>

<pre class="output">
What is the month? <span class="input">6</span>
What is the day? <span class="input">22</span>
It is June 22
</pre>


<h2>10.5 Looping Through a List</h2>
<hr />

<p>One super common thing to do with a list is to loop through everything in
the list and do something with each thing in it.  For example, we might loop
through a list of our quiz scores to add them up, or loop through a list of names
searching for one name in particular.</p>

<p>We can do this by using a for loop in Python.  We have seen for loops for
looping through strings and sequences of numbers using range().  They also work
for lists.</p>

<p>For example, if we want to print all of our quiz grades, we could write code like
this:<p>

<pre><code class="python">
quizzes = [88, 94, 76, 100, 92, 89, 95, 85, 79, 99]

for quiz in quizzes:
    print(quiz)
</code></pre>

<p>The for loop assigns each thing in the list to "quiz", one by one, and
executes the lines under the for loop on it.  In this case, it will print
all of the quiz scores to the screen one by one.  By changing the code in
the loop, we can do different things with each item.</p>

<p>To add all of the quiz scores together, we can do the following:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
quizzes = [88, 94, 76, 100, 92, 89, 95, 85, 79, 99]

total = 0
for quiz in quizzes:
    total = total + quiz

average = total / len(quizzes)
print("Your average score is", average)
</code></pre>

<p>This is much easier than having to add all 10 variables by typing them all
out!  We also can add more quiz scores to the list without having to redo the
code to find the average.  This example also shows using the <code>len</code>
function to find the length of a list &mdash; this works the same way it
does for strings.</p>



<h2>10.6 Example: Smart Guess the Number</h2>
<hr />

<p>When we first looked at using loops, we saw an example of a guess the number
program that started at 1, and then went on guessing up to 10.  To refresh your
memory, this code looked like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# guess 1 the first time
guess = 1
answer = input("Did you guess " + str(guess) + "? ")

# keep guessing the next number until they get it
while answer != "yes":
    guess = guess + 1
    answer = input("Did you guess " + str(guess) + "? ")

print("Got it!")
</code></pre>

<p>This program does in fact eventually guess the number the user is thinking
of, but it doesn't guess them in a very human-like manner.  Only a robot would
guess in order like that.  Another way is to guess the numbers randomly,
instead of in order:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import random

# guess a random number
guess = random.randint(1, 10)
answer = input("Did you guess " + str(guess) + "? ")

# keep guessing in order until we get it
while answer != "yes":
    guess = random.randint(1, 10)
    answer = input("Did you guess " + str(guess) + "? ")

print("Got it!")
</code></pre>

<p>Now the program no longer guesses the numbers in order, but it still doesn't
guess them very well.  Now each guess is random with no memory of what the
previous guesses were.  It could even guess the same number twice in a row.
What we'd like is for the number to guess the numbers from 1 to 10 in random
order without repeating itself.</p>

<p>We can do this using a list of numbers to guess and then "shuffling" the
list.  The idea here is that we will make a list to store all of the numbers
1 through 10.  Then we call the <code>random.shuffle</code> function which
takes a list and shuffles it randomly.</p>

<p>We then loop through this shuffled list and guess the numbers in it one
by one.  Now the program will guess them in a random way, but it won't ever
guess the same number twice.</p>

<p>The code to do this is below:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import random

guesses = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
random.shuffle(guesses)

for number in guesses:
     if input("Did you guess " + str(number) + "? ") == "yes":
          print("Got it!")
          break
</code></pre>

<p>There's something else new in this program which is the <code>break</code>
command.  This exits out of the loop immediately when we run it.  By doing
the break when we get the number right, we cause the loop to exit early, when
it might not have gone through all of the numbers yet.  Without this, the
program would keep asking us until it went through all 10 numbers.</p>

<p>An example run of this program is below:</P>

<pre class="output">
Did you guess 6? <span class="input">no</span>
Did you guess 8? <span class="input">no</span>
Did you guess 4? <span class="input">no</span>
Did you guess 2? <span class="input">no</span>
Did you guess 5? <span class="input">no</span>
Did you guess 1? <span class="input">no</span>
Did you guess 7? <span class="input">yes</span>
Got it!
</pre>




<h2>10.7 Splitting Input</h2>
<hr />

<p>One very helpful thing we can do with strings is to call their
<code>split</code> function, which splits the string into parts by some
separator (which we get to choose).  This can allow us to go through each word
of a sentence, for example.</p>

<p>The following program does just that.  It asks the user to input a sentence.
It then calls the <code>split</code> function to split it based on spaces.  This
gives us back a list variable (which we call words).  We can then do what we want
to with those individual words.  Here we just print them out.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# read in a whole sentence
sentence = input("Enter a sentence: ")

# split it into words (separated by spaces)
words = sentence.split(" ")

# Loop through each one
for word in words:
    print(word)
</code></pre>

<p>Below is an example run of this program:</p>

<pre class="output">
Enter a sentence: <span class="input">the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</span>
the
quick
brown
fox
jumps
over
the
lazy
dog
</pre>




<h2>10.8 Example: Reading lists of Numbers</h2>
<hr />

<p>Above we talked about a program to calculate our quiz
average for a class.  In this program we "hard-coded" our
quiz scores into the program with the following line of code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
quizzes = [88, 94, 76, 100, 92, 89, 95, 85, 79, 99]
</code></pre>

<p>Let's say that our program was so super helpful that we wanted
to share it with our friends.  We would not necessarily want them to 
have to edit our code to put in their own grades.  So instead we should
make it so the program asks you for the quiz grades.</p>

<p>There are a couple of ways to do this, but one is to make the program
read them in on one line and then split them up.  We can use any kind
of separator we want to separate the numbers.  Let's say we want to use a
comma.</p>

<p>The following program does this by asking the user to enter their
quiz grades, splitting them into individual things in a list, and then
looping through them.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# read in a whole sentence
quizzes = input("Enter quiz grades separated by commas: ")

# split it into parts
quizzes = quizzes.split(",")

# loop through each one getting total
total = 0
for quiz in quizzes:
    total = total + int(quiz)

# print average
print("Average is", total / len(quizzes))
</code></pre>

<p>One wrinkle here is that our list is actually storing strings,
because that's what the <code>split</code> function returns to us.
So when we do the adding we have got to convert the numbers to
int first.</p>

<p>Below is an example of this program being run:</p>

<pre class="output">
Enter quiz grades separated by commas: <span class="input">92,78,88,70,100,94</span>
Average is 87.0
</pre>

<p>Now we are reading in the list from the user, and looping over it to calculate
the average.</p>



<h2>10.9 Adding to a List</h2>
<hr />

<p>So far we have looked at making lists all in one go, either by getting the
list contents from <code>split</code>, or by listing the things inside
brackets, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
names = ["Bob", "Alice", "Joe", "Mary"]
</code></pre>

<p>But what if we want to add an item to a list that already exists?  This can
be done with the <code>append</code> list function.  For instance, this code
will add two new names to the list:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
names.append("Joe")
names.append("Beatrice")
</code></pre>

<p>This allows us build a list as we go, rather than create the whole thing at once.
As we will see, there are lots of cases where being able to add to a list is handy.</p>


<h2>10.10 Inserting into a List</h2>
<hr />

<p>The append function adds items on to the <em>end</em> of the list.  If we
wanted to add an item somewhere else, we can use the insert function instead.
This function takes two parameters.  The first is the index we want to insert
at.  The second parameter is the item we would like to insert.</p>

<p>The following code starts by making an empty list, and then inserting
some names into it at different positions:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
names = []
names.insert(0, "Bob")
names.insert(0, "Alice")
names.insert(1, "James")
print(names)
</code></pre>

<p>This example will print ['Alice', 'James', 'Bob'].</p>

<p>When "Bob" is inserted
at position 0, it's the only one, so the list is ["Bob"].</p>

<p>Then, when "Alice" is inserted at location 0, the list becomes ["Alice",
"Bob"].</p>

<p>Finally, when "James" is inserted at location 1, he is inserted between Alice
and Bob to make the list ["Alice", "James", "Bob"].</p>

<p>If we care about the <em>order</em> of the list, insert lets us choose where
to put new items.</p>



<h2>10.11 Example: Snowy Sky</h2>
<hr />

<p>Imagine that we want to make a snowy scene with the graphics library.  We would
want to have a whole bunch of snow flakes, let's say 500.  One way to do that would
be to make a list of flakes with all of their positions listed out, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
flakes = [Point(23, 88), Point(124, 301), Point(466, 201)...
</code></pre>

<p>But it would be a huge waste of time to list out 500 items like this.
Instead, we can start with an empty list, and then use <code>append</code> to
just keep adding points in a loop.  The following program is the start of a
"snowy scene" type of program:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *
import random

# make a blue window
window = GraphWin("Snow!", 600, 600)
window.setBackground("LightBlue3")

# make a list to store a bunch of points
flakes = []
for i in range(500):
    x = random.randint(0, 600)
    y = random.randint(0, 600)
    flakes.append(Point(x, y))

# make them all white and draw them to the screen
for flake in flakes:
    flake.setFill("white")
    flake.draw(window)

# keep looping until escape is pushed
while window.checkKey() != "Escape":
    for flake in flakes:
        # move each flake down a bit
        flake.move(0, 3)

        # if the flake is off the bottom, move it back up
        if flake.getY() &gt; 600:
            flake.move(0, -600)
window.close()
</code></pre>

<p>This program would be completely impractical to write without lists.
We could never make 500 separate variables for our snowflakes, but by
putting them in a list it's not too hard.</p>

<p>We start by opening a window and making it a light blue color.
Next, we add 500 randomly positioned snow flakes into a list.  By making
the range the same as the size of the window, they will be evenly spaced
throughout the scene.</p>

<p>Next we loop through the list and make them all white colored, and draw
them to the window.  For loops and lists go really well to together because
we often want to take some action with everything in a list like this.</p>

<p>Next we keep looping until the user hits the Escape key.  Inside the loop,
we loop through all the snowflakes again.  For each flake, we are going to
move it down 3 pixels, so it looks like the snow is falling.  Then we check
if the snowflake fell off the end of the screen.  If so, we move it way back
up to the top.</p>

<p>This program looks like this:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/snow.png"
alt="There are hundreds of tiny white dots spread across the blue
window." />
<figcaption>A snowy scene</figcaption>
</figure>






<h2>10.12 Reading in a List</h2>
<hr />

<p>We've seen one way to read in a list in Python, using the <code>split</code>
function.  Here we ask the user to enter all the values on one line, with
some separator like a space or comma.  This works well sometimes, but there
are some downsides.  One is that it reads it all in as strings, and another
is that it might be inconvenient if there's a lot of items to read.</p>


<p>Another way to input a list from the user is to read in each value
separately and then add them to the list one by one.  With this approach,
we can read them in as numbers.</p>

<p>The following program attempts to do this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
numbers = []
while True:
    item = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    numbers.append(item)
    print(numbers)
</code></pre>

<p>The only problem with this code is that it is an infinite loop.  We need to
have some way of knowing when to stop!</p>

<p>There are two ways that this could be done:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Ask the user up front how many items they would like to enter,
    and then loop that many times.  The following example does this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
quizzes = []
count = int(input("How many quizzes are there? "))

for i in range(count):
    item = int(input("Enter a quiz grade: "))
    quizzes.append(item)
</code></pre>

</li>
<li><p>Have a certain value reserved to mean "I'm done now".  A
value used in this manner is called a <em>sentinel</em> value.  If we are
entering numbers that should always be positive, like quiz grades, then we can
use -1 as the sentinel.</p>

<p>An example doing it this way is below:</p>

</li>
</ol>


<pre><code class="python">
quizzes = []
item = int(input("Enter a quiz grade: "))

while item &gt;= 0:
    quizzes.append(item)
    item = int(input("Enter a quiz grade: "))
    
print(quizzes)
</code></pre>
