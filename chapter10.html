<h2>10.1 What is a Function?</h2>

<p>We have been calling functions in Python ever since the very first "Hello World!"
program:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print("Hello World!")
</code></pre>

<p>Here we are calling the <code>print</code> function and asking it to print
the given message to the screen for us.  Every function has a job to do.  The
job of the print function is to print thins to the screen.  When we "call" a
function, we ask it to do its job.</p>

<p>Functions can have <strong>parameters</strong>, which are the things between
the parenthesis.  Parameters allow us to pass data to a function to control how
it works.  The print function prints out each of its parameters.</p>

<p>Consider the following function call:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import math
x = math.sqrt(144.0)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>math.sqrt</code> function takes a number as a parameter.  The job
it has to do is to calculate the square root of the parameter.  Unlike the
print function, the sqrt function <em>returns</em> a value.  We use parameters
to give information to a function, and return values let functions give
information back to us.  So here, 144.0 is the parameter, and the return value
will be 12.</p>

<p>Not all functions return values.  If we try to print the return value from
the <code>print</code> function, we'll get the value "None":</p>

<pre><code class="python">
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = print("Hello")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(x)
None
</code></pre>

<p>So parameters allow us to pass information to functions.  Some functions
take no parameters, some take one, and some take more.  Likewise some functions
return a value back and some do not.</p>


<hr />
<h2>10.2 Why Write Functions?</h2>

<p>In addition to calling functions that already exist, we can create our own.
There are many reasons to do this.  The first is to split our code up into more
manageable pieces.  Just like books are divided into paragraphs and chapters,
programs can be divided up into functions to make them easier to understand and
write.</p>

<p>Another reason is to decrease repetitive code.  Imagine you were writing a
Program that reads in the size of a rectangle so it can compute the area and
perimeter.  It needs the width and height to do this, and both numbers should
be greater than zero.  We should make sure that's the case, so our code to
read these values might look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# read the width
width = int(input("Width: "))
while width &lt;= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive number.")
    width = int(input("Width: "))

# read the height
height = int(input("Height: "))
while height &lt;= 0:
    print("Please enter a positive number.")
    height = int(input("Height: "))
</code></pre>

<p>This code is pretty repetitive.  The input line, while condition and loop
bodies are all basically the same.  The only things different are the variable
name being used and the input prompt.</p>

<p>Having repetitive code in programs is not ideal.  For one, we have to write
more code.  A basic tenet of programming is to not do more work than  you have
to.  Another, even bigger, reason is that now we have to <em>maintain</em> the
code in two places.  If we want to, say, make it so that it doesn't crash the
program when a letter is accidentally entered, then would have to make that
change in <em>two</em> places.  As we write larger programs that take longer to
debug, having repetitive code like this is a bad idea.</p>

<p>If we were to write a function to read in a positive number, then we can
just call upon it whenever we need to, and know that it already does this job.
That might look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# read height and width
width = readPositive("Width: ")
height = readPositive("Height: ")
</code></pre>

<p>We pass in the prompts, because that was the one thing that's really
different.  Of course we have to create the <code>readPositive</code> function
for this to work.  So we will see how to make functions next.</p>



<hr />
<h2>10.3 Writing a Function</h2>

<p>So now that we know we want to write functions, we need to know how to do
so.  Functions are created using the following syntax:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def functionName(parameters):
    line 1
    line 2
    # etc ...
</code></pre>

<p>The keyword <code>def</code> starts a function, it stands for define.
Function names follow the same rules as variable names: any letter or
underscore, followed by any numbers of letters, numbers and underscores.
Parameters are specified the same as in a function call: as a list separated by
commas inside of parenthesis.  Then the colon signifies the start of the
function.  Each line of code in the function must be indented over, as in a
loop or if statement.</p>

<p>As an example, we can define a function that prints out a greeting:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def greet():
    print("Hello!")
</code></pre>

<p>Here the function's name is <code>greet</code>, and it takes no parameters.
The body of the function is the code that will be run when the function gets
called.  This function doesn't return anything either.</p>

<p>If we run this program, nothing actually happens.  Defining a function does not
run the code inside it.  It just says what <em>would</em> happen should the function
ever actually be called.  So in order for this program to do something, we would need
to call the function after defining it, like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# define the function
def greet():
    print("Hello!")

# call the function
greet()
</code></pre>

<p>Calling the functions we make works the same as calling a functions that come
with Python.  Now the program will first define the function, and then actually
call it, so the print statement will run and we should see this:</p>

<pre class="output">
Hello!  
</pre>

<p>Functions must be defined before they are called.  So this program
will only work if the definition of greet is before the call to it.  If we flip
them around, Python would give us an error message.</p>


<hr />
<h2>10.4 Parameters</h2>

<p>Suppose we want to personalize the greet function so that it greets people
by name.  To do this, the function will need to know the name of the person it
is supposed to greet.  To send information into a function, we use parameters.
In this case, we'll add a parameter to the function that for the person's
name:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def greet(name):
    print("Hello,", name, "how are you?")
</code></pre>

<p>Now this function takes one parameter called <code>name</code>.  Inside the function,
we can refer to <code>name</code> when we need that information.  In this case, we just
print it out.  Notice that the function isn't <em>setting</em> the <code>name</code>
variable anywhere.  The function just assumes it has been set to something
already.</p>

<p>When we call the function, we pass in the actual value that should fill
in for the parameter.  For example, we add three calls to this function
in the program below:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def greet(name):
    print("Hello", name, "how are you?")

greet("Alice")
greet("Bob")
greet("Claire")
</code></pre>

<p>This program outputs the following:</p>

<pre class="output">
Hello Alice how are you?
Hello Bob how are you?
Hello Claire how are you?
</pre>

<p>Parameters let us pass information into the function to change the
way it works.  The function above just prints out its name variable,
but that will be different based on what was passed in.</p>

<p>We have to get the number of parameters right, or Python won't be
able to call the function.
If we pass the <code>greet</code> function zero parameters, or more than one
parameter, then Python will complain:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
&gt;&gt;&gt; greet()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: greet() takes exactly 1 argument (0 given)

&gt;&gt;&gt; greet("Too", "Many")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: greet() takes exactly 1 positional argument (2 given)
</code></pre>


<p>As another example, let's write a function that will print a countdown
from a starting point.  Sometimes we will want the function to print out
a countdown starting at 10 and going down to 1.  Sometimes we will want
to start at just 5 instead.</p>

<p>Because sometimes we want the starting point to be 10 and sometimes we want
it to be 5, that has to be a parameter.  We can then use that parameter, which
we will call <code>start</code>, to control the for loop that will do the
counting down.  The code for this function is below:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def countdown(start):
    for i in range(start, 0, -1):
        print(i)
    print("Done!")

countdown(10)
countdown(5)
</code></pre>

<p>We are calling the <code>countdown</code> function with two different
values for the start parameter.  The output of this program appears below:</p>

<pre class="output">
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
Done!
5
4
3
2
1
Done!
</pre>




<h2>10.5 Return Values</h2>
<hr />

<p>Now that we have seen how to pass information <em>to</em> functions using
parameters, we  will look at how to pass information back <em>from</em>
functions using return values.</p>

<p>A return value is a value that is produced by a function call.  We have seen
functions that produce return values such as <code>input</code> and <code>math.sqrt</code>.  We can
return values from our own functions using the <code>return</code> statement.
This statement takes the value we want to return.  The value we return can be
any value in a Python program such as a constant, variable or expression.</p>

<p>For example, let's say we want to write a function to calculate the area of
a rectangle.  To do this, the information we need is the width and height of the
rectangle.  Because we need to know this to do our task, these should be
parameters into the function.  The result of our work will be the area, so this
is what we should return back.  The function could look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def rectangleArea(width, height):
    area = width * height
    return area
</code></pre>

<p>The return statement sends back the value of the <code>area</code> variable
which was computed.  When we call this function, we'll need to save the value
it gives us into a variable.  If we don't than the result it gives us will be
lost (just like we have to store the value that <code>input</code> gives us
into a variable).  The following bit of code calls the function above and then
prints the result of it:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
a = rectangleArea(3, 5)
print("The area of a 3 by 5 rectangle is", a)
</code></pre>

<p>We can also take the output of a function and pass it directly as a
parameter to another function.  For instance, we can print the area of a
rectangle to the screen directly by calling it from inside of print:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print(rectangleArea(5, 7))
</code></pre>

<p>Here the rectangleArea function is called with parameters of 5 and 7.  This
function is going to return the value 35 which is then passed directly as a
parameter to the print function.  The upshot is that the 35 will be printed
directly to the screen, without being stored in a variable first.
We have actually been doing this same thing with the <code>input</code>
function for a while in code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
</code></pre>

<p>Here the <code>input</code> function's return value (a string) is passed directly to the
<code>int</code> function, which then returns us the integer version of that string.</p>


<p>A function can also have multiple <code>return</code> statements for different cases.
For example, we can write a function to convert a number grade into a letter
grade:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def numberToLetter(grade):
    if grade &gt;= 92:
        return "A"
    elif grade &gt;= 89:
        return "A-"
    elif grade &gt;= 87:
        return "B+"
    elif grade &gt;= 82:
        return "B"
    elif grade &gt;= 79:
        return "B-"
    elif grade &gt;= 77:
        return "C+"
    elif grade &gt;= 72:
        return "C"
    elif grade &gt;= 69:
        return "C-"
    elif grade &gt;= 67:
        return "D+"
    elif grade &gt;= 60:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have a <code>return</code> statement for each condition in the function.  When
Python executes this function, the first condition that is true will have its
return statement executed.</p>

<p>While we can have multiple <code>return</code> statements, we can only ever execute
one of them for each function.  As soon as we reach the <code>return</code> statement,
we leave the function and don't do anything else.  For example, this program has a statement
after the <code>return</code>:</p>


<pre><code class="python">
def rectangleArea(width, height):
    area = width * height
    return area
    print("Hello!")    # will never be printed
</code></pre>

<p>This will never print the "Hello!" message, because Python leaves the
function as soon as the <code>return</code> is done.  No statements after that
will be executed.</p>


<hr />
<h2>10.6 A couple more examples</h2>

<p>Another benefit of functions is they sometimes make code easier to read.  We
have seen that we can check if a number is even or odd by using the modulus
operator.  To refresh your memory, we can write a program to tell the user
if their age is an even number like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if age % 2 == 0:
    print("Your age is even")
else:
    print("Your age is odd")
</code></pre>

<p>What's going on is that the modulus operator divides the age variable
by 2, and checks the remainder.  If it's 0, then the age is evenly divided
by 2, so it must be even.  How this code works is not exactly clear.  To
help make this easier to read and understand, we can write functions called
<code>isEven</code> and <code>isOdd</code> to perform these calculations:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def isEven(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

def isOdd(num):
    if num % 2 == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>These functions both take a number as a parameter.  They then do the modulus
trick to determine if the number is even or odd and then return a boolean True
or False value.  Now we can call them whenever we want to know if a number is
even or odd, instead of having to write out the modulus expression
directly.</p>

<p>As another example, let's say we want to write our own version of Python's
<code>max</code> function?  Given a list of numbers, it should return the
biggest item out of it.</p>

<p>This function will take the list as a parameter.  The return value should
be the biggest item found in the list.  We can do this with the following
function:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def max(values):
    biggest = values[0]
    for v in values:
        if v &gt; biggest:
            biggest = v
    return biggest
</code></pre>

<p>Here we loop through the list and keep track of the biggest item
that we have seen so far.  Once we've gone through the whole thing,
we return the biggest.</p>

<p>Finally, let's write the code for the <code>readPositive</code>
function we talked about earlier.  To do this, we will make the prompt
for the user a parameter, then read values until one is positive, and
then use a <code>return</code> to send it back to the user.  This might
look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def readPositive(prompt):
    value = int(input(prompt))
    while value &lt;= 0:
        print("Please enter a positive number.")
        value = int(input(prompt))
    return value
</code></pre>

<p>We could even make a more general version of this function which gets a
number as input from the user between any lower and upper limits.  The limits
could be passed into the function along with the prompt.</p>

<hr />
<h2>10.7 Scope</h2>

<p><strong>Scope</strong> refers to the parts of code that can access things
like variables.  Before we used functions, we could access any variable any
place in our program, after it was created.  But when we create variables
inside of a function, they can only be accessed inside of that function.  For
example, the <code>hello</code> function below makes a variable called
<code>message</code>.  We are allowed to access that variable inside the
<code>hello</code> function, but not outside of it:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def hello():
    message = "Hello!"
    # this is OK because we're inside the function
    print(message)

# this is not allowed
print(message)
</code></pre>

<p>This program produces an error because, in the last print statement, we are
not inside of the hello function.  Therefore the variable <code>message</code> cannot be accessed.
Even if the function hello() is called, and <code>message</code> is created, we still cannot
access <code>message</code> outside of the function.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
def hello():
    message = "Hello!"
    print(message)

# call the function
hello()

# still not OK and will cause an error
print(message)
</code></pre>

<p>The scope of the <code>message</code> variable is only inside the hello
function because that's where it was made.  If we made <code>message</code>
outside of the function, this would be OK:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# message is not in a function, so its scope is the whole program
message = "Hello!"

def hello():
    # this variable CAN be called here
    print(message)

# this is OK too
print(message)
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>message</code> is set up outside of the function and <em>can</em> be accessed inside
of functions in the program.</p>

<p>Variables created outside of a function are called <strong>global</strong>
and variables inside of a function are called <strong>local</strong>.  So the
scope of a global variable is the whole program, and the scope of a local
variable is just the function it's in.</p>

<p>The reason Python works this way is to try to keep programs more organized.
If our program has a bunch of functions in it, that all make several variables,
things would become messy if all of those variables could be accessed anywhere
in the program.  By keeping the scope of a variable just to the function it was
made in, things stay organized.  If you want to use some value from a function
in other parts of your program, you need to use a <code>return</code> to send
it back.</p>


<hr />
<h2>10.8 Designing Programs with Functions</h2>

<p>When writing programs that are long and complicated, it's a good idea to
break the program up into functions.  We start the program by thinking about
what pieces we need.  We then make functions for each of the pieces and write
them one by one.  This is sometimes called a "divide and conquer" approach
because we divide the program into parts and "conquer" them one by one.</p>

<p>In general each function should do one specific job.  If a piece of code
does more than one thing, you should consider splitting it up into multiple
functions.</p>
