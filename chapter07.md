7.1 Overview
------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the last couple of chapters we looked at if and else statements, and
looping. These statements are examples of **control flow** statements,
because they control the flow of the program --- that is they change the
order the other statements run in.

In this chapter we will look at some more examples of these control flow
statements, and learn some new things we can do with them. In
particular, we will talk about *nesting* if and else statements and
loops together. Doing this will allow us to write more complex problems
and solve some problems we couldn't otherwise solve.

With these tools, we can also start to tackle some more interesting
problems. So this chapter will also talk about some techniques for
solving problems. Lastly we will look at a handful of example problems,
and talk about how we can go about breaking them down before giving code
to solve them.

7.2 Nesting Control Statements
------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

So far our programs have only used an if and else statement, or a loop
at one time. But to make more complex programs, we can start to combine
them up together. We can do that by *nesting* them together. For
example, we can put an if/else statement inside of a loop. Or a loop
inside of an if statement. Or even a loop inside of another loop.

As a first example, let's look at a program to read numbers from the
user and tell the user if each number is even or odd. The user would be
able to enter as many numbers as they want, and enter 0 to quit.

To do this, we will need a while loop to keep reading in the numbers. We
will also need an if/else statement to check if the number is even or
not. The if/else can't be *after* the loop, because it needs to check
every single number read in. Instead it has to be *inside* the loop.

The code for doing this is below:

``` {.python}
# read the first number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# keep going while it's not 0
while num != 0:
    # do the even/odd check
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")

    # get the next number
    num = int(input("Enter next number: "))
```

The `%` operator is new, so we need to explain that first. What this
does is checks the remainder of a division. For instance if we divide 13
by 5, we get 2 with a remainder of 3. So `13 % 5` is equal to `3`. If
the remainder when dividing by 2 is 0, it means there is no remainder,
so the number is even.

Here the if/else is *nested* inside of the loop. Every time the loop is
done, we check the if condition and do either the if part or the else
part. Remember that the indentation is what tells us what part of the
code is part of the loop. Since the if and else statements are indented,
they are part of the loop. That's what *nesting* means in computer
science --- that something is part of something else.

There is no restriction on nesting like this. We could instead put a
loop inside of an if statement, or a loop inside of another loop. We
could even put a loop inside of an if statement which is part of another
loop. We will see more examples of nested control structures as we go
along.

7.3 Example: Guess the Number
-----------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now that we know how to nest if statements with loops, we can finally
tackle a Python version of the "Guess the Number" algorithm we looked
at way back in Chapter 1. The algorithm is given again in pseudocode:

``` {.algorithm}
1. Set min to 1.
2. Set max to 100.
3. Set G to (max + min) รท 2 (rounding down if needed).
4. Ask if their number is G.
5. If it is, then we are done!
6. If the guess was too high, set max to (G - 1).
7. If the guess was too low, set min to (G + 1).
8. Go back to step 3.
```

Notice that we have a loop (steps 3 through 8) with an if/elif/else
statement inside of it (steps 5 through 7). So our program will need to
nest these statements too.

The Python code to solve this problem is below:

``` {.python}
# set initial values for our variables
min = 1
max = 100
done = False

while not done:
    # ask them if this is their number or not
    G = int((max + min) / 2)
    answer = input("Is your number " + str(G) + "? ")

    # respond to their answer
    if answer == "yes":
        done = True
    elif answer == "too low":
        min = G + 1
    elif answer == "too high":
        max = G - 1
    else:
        print("Answers are 'yes', 'too low', or 'too high'.")

# when we exit the loop, we have guessed the number
print("Got it!")
```

There are some things to point out about this program. First, we are
using a boolean variable, called `done` to keep track of whether or not
to exit the loop. The variable starts off as False, and we set it to
True when we find the user's number. Because our condition tells us to
keep looping while we are not done, the loop will keep going until we
guess right.

Another thing to point out is that we solve the problem of rounding down
by calling the `int` function. We have used this function to change a
string (like "12") into an integer (like 12). It can also be used to
change a float number (like 12.5) into an integer (like 12). The `round`
function could be used to round to the *nearest* whole number, but not
to always round down like we want here.

We are also calling the `str` function to convert the variable G into a
string. The reason for this is that `input` doesn't allow us to pass
multiple things to be printed like `print` does. We have to pass 1
string. We do this by joining the different parts of our questions, but
we can only join strings with the + operator --- not integers. So we use
`str` to convert from a number (like 12) into a string (like "12").

And crucially the if statement chain for testing if we got our guess
right or not is nested inside the while loop. You can tell this because
it is indented over. We need to do this because we need to do the test
for *every* guess we make, not just one.

Here is an example run of this program:

``` {.output}
Is your number 50? INPUTSTARTtoo highINPUTEND
Is your number 25? INPUTSTARTtoo lowINPUTEND
Is your number 37? INPUTSTARTtoo highINPUTEND
Is your number 31? INPUTSTARTtoo lowINPUTEND
Is your number 34? INPUTSTARTyesINPUTEND
Got it!
```

7.4 Example: Password Strength
------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's look at another example now. Many websites require user passwords
to meet certain standards. For example, our university has the following
requirements for passwords:

-   Be at least 8 characters long
-   Include at least one upper-case letter
-   Include at least one lower-case letter
-   Include at least one digit

We already know how to check if the string is long enough with the `len`
function. The other ones are a bit trickier though. The approach we will
take is to loop through the entire password one character at a time. For
each character, we will check if it is one of the three things we need
to look for.

In order to do this, we will need a couple new string methods. These are
`isupper`, `islower`, and `isdigit`. These each return true if the
string contains only upper-case letters, lower-case letters or digits
respectively. We'll call these on each letter to see what sort of
character it is.

In doing this, we also need to keep track of whether *any* of the
symbols in the password are in one of these three categories or not. We
will do this by having a boolean variable for each category. For
instance, we can have a variable called `upper` which starts at false.
Then, when we see an upper-case character, we will set it to true.

The code for solving this problem is given below:

``` {.python}
# read the password from the user
password = input("Enter password: ")

#  check the length first
if len(password) < 8:
    print("Password must be 8 characters or more.")
else:
    # length OK, now check contents
    upper = False
    lower = False
    digit = False
    
    # check each chatacter to see if it's in these categories
    for char in password:
        if char.isupper():
            upper = True
        elif char.islower():
            lower = True
        elif char.isdigit():
            digit = True
    
    # now check if all three categories are met or not
    if not upper:
        print("Password must contain an upper-case letter.")
    elif not lower:
        print("Password must contain a lower-case letter.")
    elif not digit:
        print("Password must contain a digit.")
    else:
        print("Password is accepted!")
```

This is the longest program we have seen so far! It also has a few
nested statements, so let's go through it carefully so we can be sure
to understand it. The program starts by reading in your password. Next
it does the check to see if it is at least 8 characters. If not, it
gives you a message saying it's not long enough.

The rest of the program is in the `else` statement. That means the rest
of the checks only happen when the password *is* long enough. We start
by making one variable for each category we have to check, and setting
them all to false. We will assume we don't have any of these until we
see one.

Next, we loop through every character in the string with a for loop. For
each character, we check if it's a upper-case letter, lower-case letter
or digit. In each case we set the corresponding variable to true.

When we are done going through the loop, we will have checked every
single character in the password. If any of our three boolean variables
is still false, that means that type of thing must not have been present
in the password.

We then finish up by checking those three variables in an if/elif/else
statement. If any one of them was false, we scold the user saying their
password needed one of those characters. In the else clause, we know
that their password met all the criteria, so we declare that it is
accepted.

7.5 Example: Times Tables
-------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now we will look at an example of nested loops. That would be one loop
nested inside of another loop. An example of a problem we could solve
with nested loops is the problem of printing out a times table. A times
table is a table which shows what one number multiplied by another is.
You probably had to memorize this table in grade school.

Let's say we want to print a 10 by 10 times table like the following:

``` {.output}
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   
2   4   6   8   10  12  14  16  18  20  
3   6   9   12  15  18  21  24  27  30  
4   8   12  16  20  24  28  32  36  40  
5   10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  
6   12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  60  
7   14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  70  
8   16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  80  
9   18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81  90  
```

To do this, we will need two nested loops. The first loop will loop
through each of the ten *rows* of the table. Then the inner loop will go
through each of the ten *columns* of the table. Then in that loop we
print one number. The basic algorithm would look like this:

``` {.python}
for each row:
    for each column:
        print this row number times this column number
```

Because the column loop is nested inside the row loop, it will be done
in its entirety for every row. With ten rows and ten columns, we will
get a total of 100 numbers printed out.

The Python code for this program is below:

``` {.python}
# read the size of the table
size = int(input("What size table would you like? "))

# loop through each row
for row in range(1, size + 1):
    # loop through each column
    for col in range(1, size + 1):
        # print one 'cell' of the table
        print(row * col, end="\t")
    # go to the next line after this row is done
    print()
```

There are a couple things to notice here. First, we have our nested
loops. Each loop goes through the numbers 1 to 10. We also have to give
them a different variable (`row` and `col` in this case). We couldn't
use "i" for both because then one would overwrite the other.

Also we pass `size + 1` as the end point to the `range` function. That
allows us to loop more or less depending on how big of a table the user
requested.

The print that outputs the number uses the two variables `row` and `col`
multiplied together. We don't want each number to be on a line all by
itself, so we have to tell Python not to end with a new line. Instead we
pass `end="\t"`. The `"\t"` is a *tab character*. By putting a tab after
each character, we make sure the numbers line up nicely in columns. We
could have used a space and it would have worked, just looked a little
messier.

Then we have the funky looking line that calls `print()` with nothing at
all between the parenthesis. The purpose of this is to go down to the
next line. Each time we print a number, we end with a tab. Then after
one row is done (after the inner for loop has finished), we need to go
down to the next line so the next row has room. That's what that second
print accomplishes.

Nested loops can be tricky because you have to keep track of where you
are in both at the same time.

7.6 Breaking Down Problems
--------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As we mentioned in Chapter 1, computer science is not really the study
of computers --- it is the study of algorithms. The main thing that
computer scientists do is come up with algorithms to solve various
problems. Usually they write the algorithms in a programming language
like Python, but coming up with the algorithm in the first place is
usually the hard part.

Like any intellectual skill, learning to develop algorithms is something
that takes a bunch of time and practice. That said, there are some
techniques for breaking down a problem so that you can go about solving
it. This section will give some advice for doing this.

The following are steps that I think are good to go through when
tackling a new problem:

1.  **Identify the inputs**

    Most problems have some kind of information which is given to you as
    input. Your algorithm is generally going to have to use this input
    in some way, so listing out what inputs you will need is a good
    starting point.

2.  **Identify the outputs**

    For most problems, there is also some kind of solution that you are
    looking for. If we don't have the output we are looking for firmly
    in mind, it will be hard to hit upon the right algorithm. Listing
    the outputs our algorithm is expected to produce will make sure we
    know our goal.

3.  **Solve a few examples by hand**

    Next you should solve a few examples of the problem just by hand. If
    you can't solve the problem with example inputs, then you have no
    hope of coming up with an algorithm that can solve it in general.
    When doing this, it's good to try examples of the different
    situations that could arise.

    By working through a few concrete examples, you are doing two
    things. First you are making sure that you really understand the
    problem before diving into an algorithm. Secondly, you are going
    through the steps that your algorithm will need to go through which
    will give you insight into writing it.

4.  **Write the basic steps**

    Based on what you learned working the example problems, you can now
    sketch out the algorithm. But rather than jump right into Python
    code, it's often helpful to start with righting down the basic
    steps in English first.

    The main reason for this is because it's easier to focus on just
    the algorithm and not the details of a programming language. For
    example, you don't need to worry about deciding whether things
    should be int or float, or making sure parenthesis line up right.

    This English like description of an algorithm is sometimes called
    "pseudocode" because it is sort of like computer code, but not
    really in any actual language. The main benefit of this is that it
    lets us focus on the algorithm without being distracted by details
    of Python syntax.

5.  **Test the steps**

    Another benefit of using pseudocode is that we can now test out the
    algorithm in its simple English-like steps before coding it. We
    should follow the steps a couple of times to make sure that it gets
    the right answers. If we made any mistakes, or if it is wrong in
    some cases, we can fix it before we spend the time making it a
    program. Algorithms in pseudocode can be easier to fix than programs
    in a full programming language.

6.  **Write the actual code**

    Once we are confident our basic algorithm is working, we can start
    putting it into actual code in a programming language (we'll use
    Python of course). Now instead of focusing on the problem itself, we
    will focus on the language's syntax and finding all the functions
    we need.

7.  **Test the code**

    Now we can test our code out to see if it gives us the answers that
    we expect. We should be able to plug in the inputs for the examples
    we solved by hand and get the right answers.

    Another benefit of splitting our problem-solving steps into two
    parts is that we should not have to fix problems with the actual
    algorithm any more (those should have been caught in step 5). Any
    problems now should be with translating our pseudocode steps into
    actual Python code.

Experienced programmers will often skip steps 4 and 5, and jump right
into writing code when they have an idea of how to solve a problem. The
main reason for this is that they are so comfortable with the
programming language they are using. An experienced programmer can
translate steps into code as they go. For a beginner this is harder. And
even experienced programmers will often fall back to writing the steps
in English first when they run into an especially tricky
problem[^1].

7.7 Breaking Down Problems Example
----------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an example of applying these steps, let's solve the problem of
figuring out how much somebody is paid given their hourly rate and the
number of hours they worked. If the hours worked are over 40, then the
person is paid "time and a half" for their overtime.

It's worth pointing out that the problem of solving one specific case
of this problem (like if you worked 30 hours and make 12 dollars per
hour) is just a math problem. It becomes a computer science problem when
we want to solve it *in general*. With the right algorithm, we could
solve any case of this problem at all --- no matter what the inputs are,
our algorithm will give us the right answer.

Let's go through the steps outlined above:

1.  **Identify the inputs**

    For this problem we have two pieces of input: the hourly rate and
    the number of hours worked.

2.  **Identify the outputs**

    In this case, we only want one output, which is the amount of money
    earned.

3.  **Solve a few examples by hand**

    For this problem, we should solve an example where the person
    doesn't get overtime and one where they do. Let's start with the
    case where they don't get overtime. Say they work for 30 hours, and
    make 12 dollars per hour. In this case, we should just multiply the
    two numbers together to get 30ร12 = 360.

    In the case where the employee *does* get overtime, we have to do
    something extra. Let's say they work 45 hours and make 10 dollars
    per hour. Now we need to give them 10 dollars for each of the 40
    regular hours they are working. We also need to pay them extra for
    the hours they work over 40. In this case that's 5 hours at 15
    dollars per hour. So in total we have 40ร10 + 5ร15 = 475.

4.  **Write the basic steps**

    We should use the steps we took solving the problem above to guide
    us in writing them out in pseudocode. We will have identified the
    two main cases in this problem, and might come up with something as
    straightforward as the following:

    ``` {.algorithm}
    1. Read in the hours
    2. Read in the wage
    3. If they worked 40 hours or less, pay will be (hours * wage)
    4. Otherwise, pay will be:
         40 * wage +  (hours - 40) * (wage * 1.5)
    5. Print out the pay
    ```

5.  **Test the steps**

    In this case, we can run through these steps with a couple of
    example inputs to make sure they work. We can even use the ones we
    worked through by hand to make sure they get the same answer we
    arrived at.

    If something does go wrong here, we should modify the algorithm at
    this point before moving on.

6.  **Write the actual code**

    Now that we have an algorithm that we are pretty confident with, we
    can go through and translate it into Python code. In this case, we
    can write something like this:

    ``` {.python}
    hours = float(input("How many hours did you work? "))
    wage = float(input("What is your hourly wage? "))

    if hours <= 40:
        pay = hours * wage
    else:
        pay = 40 * wage +  (hours - 40) * (wage * 1.5)

    print("Your pay will be", pay)
    ````

7.  **Test the code**

    Finally we can test this code to make sure the results it gives
    matches what we expect. We should be able to run this code and give
    it the inputs we tested in step 3 to make sure it gets the same
    result that we got.

Because this problem isn't *terribly* difficult, many of you could
probably have jumped straight into code. The point of this section is to
give an example of solving problems this way. These steps will be
helpful to at least think about when you encounter trickier problems.

7.8 Flowcharts
--------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Another tool that computer scientists use to solve problems before
jumping into code is the flowchart. A flowchart shows the steps of an
algorithm, just like pseudocode does. A flowchart however makes the
decisions in the algorithm really clear by having arrows that show what
steps happen when.

Below is an example of a flowchart for the overtime program:

![A flowchart showing the steps in the pay calculator
algorithm.](images/flow1.png)

The flowchart shows the algorithm in a slightly more graphical way. Each
box in the chart displays one step of the algorithm. The nice thing
about a flowchart is that it makes the control flow statements really
clear. In this case, you can see the decision (which is typically shown
with a diamond shape in a flowchart), with branches for the "yes" and
"no" cases.

Flowcharts also make loops easy to spot. We can make a flowchart for the
problem of reading a valid age from the user. The steps in the following
algorithm keep asking the user for an age until they put in something
that's not negative:

![A flowchart showing the steps of reading a valid age from the
user.](images/flow2.png)

You can see the loop in this algorithm because of the arrow that's
pointing back to a previous step (that's the arrow pointing from the
"Read age again" step back around to the decision). Making flowcharts
can be helpful as you are working on an algorithm, as they can help you
understand the order that the steps need to be done in.

**Chapter Summary**
:::

::: {.blackbox-contents}
-   If, elif and else statements, along with our loop statements form
    Python's "control flow" statements. These allow us to control the
    order that program instructions are done in.
-   These control flow statements can be combined, or nested, any way we
    like. We can put a loop inside of an if statement, or an if
    statement inside of a loop for example. This ability allows us to
    solve more complex problems.
-   When tackling a new problem, there are some steps to go about
    solving the problem:
    1.  Identify the inputs
    2.  Identify the outputs
    3.  Solve a few examples by hand
    4.  Write the steps needed in plain English
    5.  Test these steps and look for problems with them
    6.  Translate your algorithm into code
    7.  Test the code you've written
-   You can use pseudocode or flowcharts to work on the general solution
    to a problem before diving into code.
-   To get better at algorithmic problem solving, you need to practice
    solving problems!

Footnotes {#footnote-label .visually-hidden}
---------

[^1]: When I personally am writing programs, I will often start by
    writing my "basic steps" as comments in my program files. Then I
    read through and make sure the steps make sense before jumping into
    the code. Then, I add the code, but leave the comments in to explain
    how the code is working. I find this method works well.
