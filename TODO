 - Maybe get rid of flowcharts from chapter 7?

 - Add constants like pi to chapter 8?

 - Move the discussion of functions and objects from 9 into 8.

 - use "method" instead of "function" when applicable

 - add break to chapter on loops?  I use it in chapter10 example

 - collapse some of the examples into the sections above.  Instead of 10+
   sections, we should be at like 7 or 8

 - In functions chapter, use something besides Pong in motivating example!

 - add something to 11 about the mechanics of function calls - pausing execution
   and then jumping back and such.

 - in 11 I say we've seen even/odd checks....but have we?

 - AI chapter explaining approaches including neural networks, also cyber chapter, and others???

 - switch graphics to PyGame

 - Replace the figures with svg ones
