After Fall 2019:
 - Split chapter 2 into chapters 1 (what is IDE and interpreter?, installing)
    and chapter 3 (hello world, comments, prints, etc.)

 - Be consistent with whether algorithms/programs are in titled boxes or not

 - Maybe get rid of flowcharts from chapter 7?

 - Add constants like pi to chapter 8?

 - Move the discussion of functions and objects from 9 into 8.

 - go through and make sure all the code things are in code tags.
   Also, change the CSS to make them clearer (maybe a background color?)

 - make sure screenshots have consistent title bar look

 - use "method" instead of "function" when applicable??

 - add break to chapter on loops?  I use it in chapter10 example

 - make inline code tag styling more distinctive, and be consistent with them
