Preface
=======

This book is designed to introduce the reader to the field of computer
Science. It is intended to be used in a one-semester college level
course. It could also be used for self-study.

This book uses the Python programming language for coding. However the
goal is not really to cover Python itself. Instead Python is just used
as a means to learn about developing algorithms and solving problems. In
particular, we will not spend too much time talking about
Python-specific features. We will also not always do things in the most
Python-specific way. For example, we will look at how to solve some
problems "by hand" that could be done just by calling Python methods.
The goal of this book is to teach you the core ideas of computer science
which are independent of any particular language.
