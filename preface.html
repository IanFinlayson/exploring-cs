<h1>Preface</h1>

<p>This book is designed to introduce the reader to the field of computer
science.  It is intended to be used in a one-semester college level course.
TODO: a bit more here</p>

<p>This book uses the Python programming language for coding.  However the goal
is not really to cover Python itself.  Instead Python is just used as a means
to learn about developing algorithms and solving problems.  In particular, we
will not spend too much time talking about Python-specific features.  The goal
of this book is to teach you the core ideas of computer science which are
independent of any particular language.</p>
