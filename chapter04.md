4.1 What are Types?
-------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just like us, programs need to keep track of information as they are
solving problems or making decisions. They do this by storing data
inside of variables. Last chapter, we saw how to create variables and
also how to read input from the user and store it in variables. We
didn't talk about this, but we did it using one type of data, called
the string type.

Python actually provides multiple types of data. A **type** is something
associated with a variable that determines what sorts of things you can
do with it. To be able to use a variable, you need to know what type it
has.

For example, you probably have a first name like "Anne", and a last
name, like "Smith". In Python, these are called *strings*. You can do
some things with strings like join them together, to get "Anne Smith".
Or see how many letters they have. Other things don't make sense to do
with strings. For example, you can't subtract strings --- that just
doesn't make any sense.

You also have a birth year, like 1998. You can do different things with
that piece of information. For example, you *can* subtract it from other
numbers. We can subtract 1998 from the current year to see how old you
are.

Python has several different types for dealing with different kinds of
information like this. In this chapter, we will look at strings and
numbers. We will also talk about some of the operations we can do with
these.

4.2 Strings
-----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The first type that we will look into is the **string** type. A string
is some text inside of a program. For instance a message, name, address,
email, password, URL etc. are all textual and would be stored as strings
in a Python program.

Strings can be created by enclosing text inside of double quotes:


``` {.python}
name = "Anne Smith"
print(name)
```

Strings can also be enclosed inside of single quotes instead:


``` {.python}
name = 'Anne Smith'
print(name)
```

There is usually no difference between the two ways of making strings.
The exception is when a string *contains* a quote. For example, this
program is just not going to work:


``` {.python}
answer = input("Answer "yes" or "no" here ")
print(answer)
```

The problem here (which you can see from the way the code is
highlighted) is that when Python sees the `"` at the start of `"yes"`,
it thinks that the string is over. Then it gets really confused because
it can't figure out what to do with the yes. To fix this, we can use
single quotes instead:


``` {.python}
answer = input('Answer "yes" or "no" here ')
print(answer)
```

Now this is OK because Python knows that the string is not over until it
sees the second `'` symbol. This goes the other way too. For example
this program has an error:


``` {.python}
print('You can't enter a negative number!')
```

But this one is fine:


``` {.python}
print("You can't enter a negative number!")
```

Personally, I always use the double-quotes unless the string I am
writing needs to have double-quotes in it.

4.3 Joining Strings
-------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Next we will talk about some of the operations that you can do with
strings. The first one we will talk about is joining strings, which is
also sometimes called concatenating[^1].

This is done by putting two existing strings together with a + in
between them. For example, the following program asks the user for their
first and last name, and then joins them together to form a full name:


``` {.python}
# read the names from the user
first = input("What is your first name? ")
last = input("What is your last name? ")

# join them together in a new variable
fullName = first + last

print(fullName)
```

Below is an example of this program being run:

``` {.output}
What is your first name? INPUTSTARTAnneINPUTEND
What is your last name? INPUTSTARTSmithINPUTEND
AnneSmith
```

This program has three variables, which are all strings. The first
contains the input the user gave for the first name ("Anne" in this
example), the second contains the last name ("Smith"), and the third
is created by joining the two names ("AnneSmith"), which is then
printed out.

We can add as many strings together as we want. For example, we can make
it so there is a space between the users first and last name by joining
a space in between them. The program with this fix is here:

**Program 4.1**


``` {.python}
# read the names from the user
first = input("What is your first name? ")
last = input("What is your last name? ")

# join them together in a new variable, with a space
fullName = first + " " + last

print(fullName)
```

4.4 String Length and Indexing
------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

A string is a sequence of one or more *characters*. A character is just
a single symbol of text, such as a letter, numeral, punctuation or
space. For instance, the string string `"Hello World!"` has 12
characters: 10 letters, a space, and an exclamation mark.

We can get the length of a string by using the `len` function. The
following program will get a string from the user and then print how
long it is:

**Program 4.2**


``` {.python}
# program to print the length of the user's input
response = input("Enter a string: ")
length = len(response)
print("That string has", length, "characters.")
```

Below is an example run of this program:

``` {.output}
Enter a string: INPUTSTARTHello out there!!INPUTEND
That string has 17 characters.
```

We can also get any individual characters out of a string if we want to.
Each character in a string has an *index*. The index starts at 0 and
goes up by 1 for each character. For instance, the string "Hello" has
these indices:

![The indices of a string](images/string-index.png)

Notice that, while there are 5 letters, the indices go from 0 to 4, and
that 5 is not the index of any letter. To get just one character from a
string, we put the name of the string, then the index we want inside of
square brackets.

For example, we can write a program that prints out the first letter of
our input like this:

**Program 4.3**


``` {.python}
# program to print just the first letter of the user's input
response = input("Enter a string: ")
first = response[0]
print(first)
```

Here is an example of this program running:

``` {.output}
Enter a string: INPUTSTARTHello out there!!INPUTEND
H
```

This may not seem terribly useful, but getting the characters out of a
string is sometimes necessary. For example, if a string has several
things in it, like a first name and a last name, you may need to look at
each character to see where the first name ends and the last name
begins.

4.5 String Methods
------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are other things we can do with strings, but first we need to talk
about a new term. We have seen several functions `print` and `input`
which are called *functions*. There is a similar concept in Python
called a **method** which is like a function, but is called on a
variable. To call a method, you give the variable, then a `.` then the
name of the method, and finally parenthesis.

For instance, strings have a method called `upper` which gives back a
version of the string in all capital letters. We can call this method
like this:


``` {.python}
mesg = input("Enter a message: ")

allcaps = mesg.upper()
print(allcaps)
```

Here we get a string from the user with `input`. Then we call the
`upper` method on that string. This gives us back a new string with all
the lower-case letters swapped for capital ones. We then print that out.
Here's an example run:

``` {.output}
Enter a message: INPUTSTARThello there.INPUTEND
HELLO THERE.
```

There is also a method called `lower` which gives us the all lower-case
version. There are a few more helpful methods that we will see in
examples later in this book. The important thing to take note of here is
that these methods only make sense on strings. Numbers, or other types
of data can't be lower-case or upper-case. So the type of thing you
have is important.

4.6 Numbers
-----------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Many programs work with numerical data, so numbers are another important
type in Python. As we will see, numbers come up a lot more in
programming than you might think. Even things like games need lots of
numbers to work. For example, the positions of everything on the screen
are stored as numbers.

Python actually has a few different types of numbers for different
situations.

The first is the integer, or `int` type. Integers are numbers that have
no fractional component. For example, an int can be equal to 3, or 4,
but not 3.5. Integers can be positive or negative. Some languages have
limits on how big an integer can be, but Python allows integers to be as
big as they need to be[^2].

We can create an integer just by putting a number into a program. We can
also assign it to a variable to keep track of it. For example, to create
a variable to keep track of the year someone was born, we could do so
like this:


``` {.python}
birthYear = 1998
```

Integers cannot have any fractional component. So if we make a number
that does have a fraction in it, Python gives it a different type,
called a `float`[^3]:


``` {.python}
size = 10.2
```

A float is a number which can have a fractional part. That fractional
part might be 0 though. For example, if you make a variable equal to
3.0, then it will be stored as a float, which just happens to have the
fractional part equal to 0.

You may wonder why not just have all numbers be floats, since they can
have fractional parts, but also can be set to numbers without a
fractional part. The reason is that floats don't store numbers exactly;
they only store approximations of them. The reason for this is that some
numbers, like Pi, would require infinite memory to store exactly.

We can see this effect by giving Python certain computations like the
following (the \>\>\> indicates that line is typed into the shell
window):

``` {.python}
>>> 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
```

Of course the answer should really be 0.3, but Python gives us a number
that is almost, but not exactly, 0.3. This might seem like a flaw in
Python, but it just comes from the fact that there are infinitely many
real numbers between 0 and 1 --- we can't store them all perfectly in a
computer. That's just life. The small amount of imprecision we get with
floats is normally not an issue.

As a rule of thumb, you should use integers when a number won't have a
fractional component, because integers are exact. When a number might
have a fraction, you have to use a float.

4.7 Number Input
----------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To read in a float from the user, we can't just use the `input`
function. This always gives us a string, even if the user types in a
number. You can see this in the following shell example, where we read
in a variable and then check its type. The `type` function returns the
type of what you give it:

``` {.python}
>>> num = input("Enter a number ")
Enter a number 7
>>> type(num)
<class 'str'>
```

This is probably confusing, because 7 obviously *is* a number. But
strings can contain digits too. For instance, if you are reading in an
address, it might be something like `"1301 College Avenue"`. So strings
can contain numbers inside of them. This one just happens to contain
only a number. Python doesn't automatically set the type based on what
the user types in.

Now because it's a string, we can't really use it like a number. For
example, if we try to add this variable to another number, we will get
an error.

In order to actually get a number from the user, we need to convert it
into either an int or float first. This can be done by putting either
`int()` or `float()` around the input line, like this:


``` {.python}
num1 = int(input("Enter an integer "))
num2 = float(input("Enter a float "))
```

The first example will read in the user's input and convert it to an
integer. The second will convert it into a float. If the user puts in
something that is not correct, the program will stop with an error. For
example, if we put in "3.5" for the first line, or "banana" for
either line, the program won't continue.

We'll learn how to catch these sorts of errors and handle them later
on.

4.8 Doing Math
--------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once we have numbers inside a Python program, there are lots of things
we can do with them. We saw that + can be used to join together strings.
With numbers it adds them together. The following program reads two
float numbers from the user and then adds them together, displaying the
result:

**Program 4.4**


``` {.python}
# this program adds two numbers given by the user
num1 = float(input("Enter a number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter a number: "))
total = num1 + num2
print("The total is", total)
```

This program reads in the two numbers from the user, and stores them in
variables called `num1` and `num2`. It then adds them together using the
+ operation. Because these are numbers, this results in getting the sum
of the two. This is why types are important --- if they were strings it
would have joined them. The result of the addition is stored in the
variable called "total" which is then printed to the screen.

Of course Python has other operations besides just addition. Below is a
list of some operators that Python supports:

  Operator   Meaning
  ---------- ----------------
  \+         Addition
  \-         Subtraction
  \*         Multiplication
  /          Division
  \*\*       Exponentiation

Using the + and - symbols for addition and subtraction is probably
pretty familiar to you. Some of the others might take a little while to
get used to.

Programming languages were made with standard American keyboards in
mind, so the symbol for multiplication is the asterisk (\*) instead of ×
or · symbols used more in math. Likewise we use the / symbol for
division instead of the ÷ symbol. The symbols were picked to make them
easier to type when writing code.

Notice that exponents are done with two asterisks `**`. A fairly common
mistake is to use the caret symbol \^ instead. This could have been
used, but actually means something else in Python[^4].

Python follows the standard mathematical rules of precedence which can
be overridden with parenthesis.

4.9 Example: Tips
-----------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

As an example of working with numbers, let's write a program that can
figure the amount that you should tip a server at a restaurant. When the
bill comes at a restaurant, it's expected that diners will give a tip
between 15 and 20 percent of the price of the meal. This can sometimes
be tricky to figure out[^5], so let's write a
program to figure it out for us!

The program should start off by asking the user how much their meal
cost. To do that, we will need to use `input` combined with the `float`
function to read in a number that may have a fractional part:


``` {.python}
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))
```

Next, we need to do a little math. If the user wants to give a 15% tip,
then we should multiply the amount by 1.15. This will give a new number
which is equal to the original amount, but is 15% more. We should save
this number into a new variable:


``` {.python}
total = cost * 1.15
```

One mistake beginning programmers sometimes make is to not put the
answer to something like this in a variable. For instance they might
write a line like this:


``` {.python}
# wrong
cost * 1.15
```

This line of code doesn't really do anything. It multiplies cost by
1.15, but it doesn't save the answer anywhere. In order to make use of
a result like this, we have to put it into a variable.

Now that we have the amount with a tip added in, we can print it for the
user:


``` {.python}
print("The amount with tip is", total)
```

This will print out the full amount with tip added in, which we have
just calculated. The whole program with comments added is below:

**Program 4.5**


``` {.python}
# read in the starting cost
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))

# figure out the cost with a 15% tip added
total = cost * 1.15

# print the result
print("The amount with 15% tip is", total)
```

Below is an example of running this program:

``` {.output}
How much was the bill? INPUTSTART32.40INPUTEND
The amount with 15% tip is 37.26
```

This program would be quite helpful in figuring out how much to tip a
server, but we can make it even better. What if someone wants to tip 20%
instead? We could of course just change the `1.15` in the program to
`1.20` instead.

But it would be even better if we asked the user how much they want to
tip and then use that amount instead of a pre-determined amount.

So to start let's ask them **two** questions instead of just one:


``` {.python}
# read in the starting cost and tip amount
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))
percentage = int(input("How much do you want to tip? "))
```

Now we have two variables. The first one, `cost`, will store the cost of
the meal before tipping. The second one, `percentage`, will store the
percentage the user wants to tip.

Now we need to do a little bit of math. The first thing we need to do is
to divide the percentage they entered by 100. That way we can go from 15
to the .15 that we need. The word "percent" actually means divided by
100.

Next we need to add 1 to this number. That way we go from the .15 to the
1.15 we used in the first program. Except now it will work with any
percentage.

Then we can multiply that number by the cost of the meal. Altogether,
that gives us this line of code:


``` {.python}
total = cost * (1 + percentage/100) 
```

Notice that we used parenthesis to make sure to do the addition before
the multiplication. The new and improved version of the program is
below:

**Program 4.6**


``` {.python}
# read in the starting cost and tip amount
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))
percentage = int(input("How much do you want to tip? "))

# figure out the cost with the tip added in
total = cost * (1 + percentage/100)

# print the result
print("The amount with tip is", total)
```

And here is an example of running it:

``` {.output}
How much was the bill? INPUTSTART41.40INPUTEND
How much do you want to tip? INPUTSTART20INPUTEND
The amount with tip is 49.68
```

4.10 Rounding
-------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

One last thing before we close out this chapter. I sort of carefully
chose the inputs to the last program so that the output looked right. If
we had picked other things, it would not look as nice. For example:

``` {.output}
How much was the bill? INPUTSTART37.21INPUTEND
How much do you want to tip? INPUTSTART17INPUTEND
The amount with tip is 43.5357
```

That just looks weird when we're talking about money. We always round
money to the nearest cent. We would not expect to see something like
this, so let's talk about how to fix it.

The best way is to round the result to 2 decimal places. This is done
with the `round` function, which takes the number we want to round and
how many decimal places to round to. We can try this in the shell


``` {.python}
>>> round(43.5357, 2)
43.54
```

`round` always rounds to the *nearest* place. For instance
`round(4.7, 0)` rounds up to 5, while `round(4.3, 0)` will round down to
4.

The program with this fix in place would look like this:

**Program 4.7**


``` {.python}
# read in the starting cost and tip amount
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))
percentage = int(input("How much do you want to tip? "))

# figure out the cost with the tip added in
total = cost * (1 + percentage/100)

# round the answer to 2 decimal places
rounded = round(total, 2)

# print the result
print("The amount with tip is", rounded)
```

This is a pretty advanced program! It takes two pieces of input, uses
four variables, and does some sort of tricky math. It even makes sure
that the output looks like the user would expect. Even better it
actually solves a real-life problem most of us can appreciate. If you
followed what we've done here, then great job!
