<h3>3.1 Output</h3>
<hr />


<p>In our first Python program, we saw the <code>print</code> instruction which
prints whatever message is put between the parenthesis.  Here it is again:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print("Hello World!")
</code></pre>

<p><code>print</code> is the main way for doing output in Python.  Of course,
we can have multiple print statements in a program.  The following program
has three prints:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print("Welcome to this program!")
print("Hello World!")
print("Bye bye!")
</code></pre>

<p>When a program has more than one line like this, Python will do them one
by one.  This is an important point of programming.  Unless we tell Python
otherwise, it starts with the first instruction, then goes through them in
order until it gets to the end.</p>

<p>So this program will print the first line, then the second, and then the
third.  The output of this program looks like this:</p>

<pre class="output">
Welcome to this program!
Hello World!
Bye bye!
</pre>

<p>In this book, we will display code in the blocks with a light grey
background, and what the programs output with a darker background.</p>

<p>As you can see, this program prints three lines of output, one for
each of our three print statements.  We will look at more things we can
do with print statements in a bit, but first we will look at input.</p>



<h3>3.2 Input</h3>
<hr />

<p>We can also do input in Python, when we want to ask the user for
information.  Most programs take some sort of input, which allows us to control
what the program is doing, or what values it is calculating with.</p>

<p>This can be done with an <code>input</code> instruction.  Like
<code>print</code>, <code>input</code> can take a message inside of
parenthesis.  In the case of input, this message is a question to give the
user, called a <strong>prompt</strong>.</p>

<p>Here is an example of how the <code>input</code> command works<a class="anchor" id="back1">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note1" aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
input("How are you feeling today? ")
</code></pre>

<p>When we run this program, it will print the prompt to the screen for us, and
then wait for us to type something in.  To give the program the input it's waiting
for, we have to type into the shell window at the bottom of the screen.  When you
type something in and hit enter, it will take the input:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/input.png"
alt="The shell window at the bottom of Thonny is where you put input in." />
<figcaption>Giving the program input</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As you can see, Thonny also colors what we are typing in blue, and what
the program outputs as black.</p>

<p>We can only type one line of text.  As soon as we hit enter, Python moves on
from the input instruction.  In this case, there is no next instruction so the
program finishes.</p>

<p>This program does not actually <em>do anything</em> with the input we give it.
In the program above, whatever the user types in can't really affect the program
at all.  The program is ignoring whatever input the user gives it.  In order to
do something with input, we must put it into a <i>variable</i>.</p>




<h3>3.2 Variables</h3>
<hr />

<p>We talked about variables briefly when we were talking about algorithms back
in Chapter 1.  Here we will talk about how to use them in Python.</p>

<p>Variables in programming are names that we associate with some piece of
information.  Variables let us refer back to something that was created earlier
on in a program.  They also let us save whatever the user inputs, so we can keep
track of it.</p>

<p>The way that a variable is created in Python is by putting the name on the
left hand side, then an equals sign, and finally the thing that you want to
save.  For instance, if we want to save our user's input in a variable, we
could do it like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
answer = input("How are you feeling today? ")
</code></pre>

<p>Now when we run this program, it will ask us the question, and wait for us
to enter a response.  It will then save whatever we give it into the variable
called "answer".  We can now change the program so that it prints it back to
us:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
answer = input("How are you feeling today? ")
print("You said")
print(answer)
</code></pre>

<p>Here is an example of the output of this program:</p>

<pre class="output">
How are you feeling today? <span class="input">pretty good</span>
You said
pretty good
</pre>

<p>The text that we typed in is highlighted so that you can see what
the program's input is.</p>

<p>There are a couple of things to note about this program.  First, we
have saved the input we typed into the variable called <code>answer</code>.
We can then print this variable out on the third line of the program.  This
line of code is worth talking about:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print(answer)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how this did not actually print "answer".  When we print a variable,
it doesn't print the variable's <em>name</em>, it prints the variable's
<em>value</em>.  Whatever got stored in the variable (which is whatever we
typed in), gets printed here.</p>

<p>Also, notice how there are no quotation marks around "answer" in the print
command.  If we put quotation marks in, it <em>would</em> actually have printed
out the word "answer".  We have to use quotation marks to print some message
out exactly, and no quotation marks when we want to get the thing stored in a
variable.</p>

<p>There are some rules for making variables.  The name of a variable has to be
made of letters, numbers and underscore characters.   They cannot begin with a
number and cannot have spaces in them.</p>

<p>These are examples of legal variable names:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>price</code></li>
<li><code>price_in_dollars</code></li>
<li><code>priceFor2</code></li>
</ul>

<p>And these are not legal:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>full-price</code> (the - symbol is not allowed)</li>
<li><code>2_times_price</code> (can't start with a number)</li>
<li><code>price in dollars</code> (no spaces are allowed)</li>
</ul>

<p>Variables also should not be named something that already means something in
Python.  That means that you should not name a variable <code>print</code> or
<code>input</code>.  There are lots of other names in Python that mean things
and we will see them as we go.</p>

<p>Notice that Thonny colors <code>print</code> and <code>input</code>
differently than other things.  If the variable you want shows up colored like
this, then it means something special and you should pick another name!</p>


<h3>3.3 More on Printing</h3>
<hr />

<p>In the program above, we printed two messages on two different lines, which
looks kind of weird.  Instead, we can put them in one line, and only use one
print instruction.  To do that, we can pass the message and the variable to
print on one line, separated by a comma.  That would look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
answer = input("How are you feeling today? ")
print("You said", answer)
</code></pre>

<p>When we run this program, it will look like this:</p>

<pre class="output">
How are you feeling today? <span class="input">pretty good</span>
You said pretty good
</pre>

<p>There is no limit to how many things we can print like this &mdash; we can just
keep adding things and putting commas between them.  Like if we want to also
print "Bye!" so the user knows the program is done, we could add that in:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
answer = input("How are you feeling today? ")
print("You said", answer, ". Bye!")
</code></pre>

<p>Now the program prints this:</p>

<pre class="output">
How are you feeling today? <span class="input">pretty good</span>
You said pretty good . Bye!
</pre>

<p>Notice that Python automatically puts a space between the things that we are
printing.  This is often helpful, but in this case makes the output look kind
of weird since there is a space before our period.  When we want to avoid this,
we can also give the text <code>sep=""</code> to print.  This tells Python to
separate the things it's printing with nothing at all.  Now the program looks
like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
answer = input("How are you feeling today? ")
print("You said ", answer, ". Bye!", sep="")
</code></pre>

<p>And it will output the following:</p>

<pre class="output">
How are you feeling today? <span class="input">pretty good</span>
You said pretty good. Bye!
</pre>

<p>Note that we had to now put a space between "You said" and the variable because
now there isn't one put in automatically.  Some people aren't too bothered about
details like this, but I like to get the spacing to look exactly right for the
program's output.</p>






<h3>3.4 Example: Greeting Program</h3>
<hr />

<p>Now let's create a slightly longer program which will need two
variables.  We'll talk about how the program will behave first, and then
talk about how to write it.</p>

<p>We want the program to ask the user for two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Their name</li>
<li>What day of the week it is</li>
</ol>

<p>It will then give them a personalized greeting wishing them to
have a good day.  For example, if we put in "Nicole" and "Thursday",
then it would print this:</p>

<pre class="output">
Hello Nicole!
Have a great Thursday!
</pre>

<p>However, if we put in "Tim" and "Monday" when the program asks
our name and what day it is, then it will print this:</p>

<pre class="output">
Hello Tim!
Have a great Monday!
</pre>

<p>This is an important point in programming &mdash; what the program
does will depend on the input given to it.  It means that we can't
just write the program like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print("Hello Nicole!")
print("Have a great Thursday!")
</code></pre>

<p>If we did, then it works if your name is Nicole, and it happens to be
Thursday, but it won't work in any other case.  You also can't just replace
"Nicole" and "Thursday"  with your own name and day.  If you do, it will work
for you that day, but not in any other situation.</p>

<p>What we want is to have the program do the right thing in <em>every</em>
situation.  For that, we need to put the name and the day into variables.  We
will need one for each thing.  One variable generally keeps track of one piece
of information.</p>

<p>We will start by asking the user their name and storing the result into a
variable:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
name = input("What is your name? ")
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we need to ask them for the other piece of information we need, the
day of the week:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
day = input("What day is it? ")
</code></pre>

<p>Now we have these two variables, which we have called <code>name</code> and
<code>day</code>.  The next step is to do the printing.  Now we will use our
variables so that whatever answers they gave to those questions will be
repeated:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print("Hello ", name, "!", sep="")
</code></pre>

<p>This will print "Hello ", followed by the user's name, and then an exclamation
point, with no spaces in between (so the exclamation shows up right after their
name).</p>

<p>Now it should greet them by name no matter what they put in.  We can do the same
thing to wish them a good day:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
print("Have a great ", day, "!", sep="")
</code></pre>

<p>Below is the whole program, with a comment at the top.  It's a good idea
to put a comment at the top explaining what the point of the program is.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# this program gives the user a custom greeting
name = input("What is your name? ")
day = input("What day is it? ")

print("Hello ", name, "!", sep="")
print("Have a great ", day, "!", sep="")
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the program also has a blank line in it.  Blank lines are ignored
just like comments are.  In longer programs, it's common to put a blank line
between sections &mdash; kind of like paragraphs in a paper.</p>

<p>Below is an example run &mdash; though of course what it prints exactly
depends on what you tell it!</p>

<pre class="output">
What is your name? <span class="input">Mary</span>
What day is it? <span class="input">Friday</span>
Hello Mary!
Have a great Friday!
</pre>
