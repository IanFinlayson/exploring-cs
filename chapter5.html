<h3>5.1 Decisions in Algorithms</h3>
<hr />

<p>So far, our programs have all started on the first line and executed each
line in sequence until the end of the program.  However, many algorithms have
the need to make decisions and do different things at different times.</p>

<p>For example, when we talked about algorithms back in chapter 1, we came up
with the following for guessing a number when the player just answered "yes" or
"no":</p>

<strong>Algorithm 1</strong>
<pre><code class="ini">
1. Set G to 1.
2. Ask if their number is G.
3. If it was, then we are done!
4. If it was not, then add 1 to G.
5. Go back to step 2.
</code></pre>

<p>Here the algorithm needs to make a decision based on the information it has
available to it.  If the guess was right, we do one thing.  Otherwise we do
another.  Lots of algorithms have to do things like this.</p>

<p>Another example is adding numbers.  When you are adding a column of numbers
you have to make a decision on whether to carry or not.  You check if the
column totals more than 9.  If so, you carry the tens place to the next
column.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we will talk about how to write Python programs that make
decisions like this.



<h3>5.2 If Statements</h3>
<hr />

<p>The way that we can make decisions like this in Python is with
an <em>if statement</em>.  If statements in Python start with the
word <code>if</code>, followed by some sort of condition, then a
colon.</p>

<p>A <strong>condition</strong> is something that might be either true or
false.  For example, if we read in a number from the user, it might be
bigger than 10, or it might not.  To check this, we could use the following
if statement:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
if number &gt; 10:
</code></pre>

<p>After this line, we put all of the code that we want to happen when
the condition is true.  For example, we can just print a message that
the number is bigger than 10 with a program like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number &gt; 10:
    print("That is bigger than 10.")
</code></pre>

<p>When Python runs this program it will check if the of the number being
bigger than is true or not.  If it is, Python will execute the print statement.
If the condition is false, that line will not be executed.</p>

<p>If we run this program and put in a number bigger than, we will see the message
like this:</p>

<pre class="output">
Enter a number: <span class="input">50</span>
That is bigger than 10.
</pre>

<p>However, if we put in something smaller than 10, the program will
<strong>not</strong> run the print message, and we will see nothing:</p>

<pre class="output">
Enter a number: <span class="input">5</span>
</pre>


<h3>5.3 Indentation and Spacing</h3>
<hr />

<p>Notice that the print message in the program above was indented.  Sometimes
spaces don't matter in Python programs, but here these spaces before the print
are actually really important.
Python uses indentation to mark if lines are part of an if statement or not.</p>

<p>For example, we can add some more message to the program above, and whether
they are indented or not will determine if they are "part of" the if statement:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number &gt; 10:
    print("That is bigger than 10.")
    print("Good job putting such a big number!")
print("Bye bye!")
</code></pre>

<p>The first two messages, the ones which are indented, will only be executed
when the number is bigger than 10.  However, the message which says "Bye bye!"
will be printed every single time the program runs &mdash; whether the
condition is met or not.  That's because it's not indented, so it's not part
of the if statement.</p>

<p>For this to work, we need to indent our code correctly so Python can tell if
it's part of an if statement or not.  Code should normally not be indented, but
if it's part of an if, it should be. If you mix up indentation, Python will get
confused.  For instance, code like this will not work:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number &gt; 10:
    print("That is bigger than 10.")
  print("In between")
print("Bye bye!")
</code></pre>

<p>Here Python will be confused because it doesn't know what to do with the
second message.  Is it part of the if block or not?</p>





<h3>5.4 Comparisons</h3>
<hr />

<p>In the example above we used the <code>&gt;</code> operator to compare two
numbers and decide which one was bigger.  Of course we can also check if
something is less than something else.  Or if two things are equal or not.
Python uses the following comparison operators:</p>

<table>
<tr><td><code>&lt;</code></td><td>Less than.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&gt;</code></td><td>Greater than.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&lt;=</code></td><td>Less than or equal to.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&gt;=</code></td><td>Greater than or equal to.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>==</code></td><td>Equal to.</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>!=</code></td><td>Not equal to.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> operators will be familiar to
most people from math.  However Python is designed so its easy to type code on
a regular keyboard.  So instead of the &le; &ge; and &ne; symbols, Python uses
<code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>!=</code>.</p>

<p>Also notice that to check if two things are equal, Python uses
<strong>two</strong> equal signs.  That's because a single <code>=</code>
is already used for something: assigning variables.  It's a pretty common
mistake to forget to put the second equal sign in.</p>

<p>For instance, if we want to read in a users age, and make sure that
it is a positive number, we could do it with a comparison:</p>




<h3>5.5 Example: Checking Input</h3>
<hr />

<p>One common use of if statements is to check if the input users
enter makes sense or not.  For example, if we ask the user their
age, they could enter a value that doesn't make sense like -7, or
3000.</p>

<p>We can use if statements to write a program which will check if
the age given is too low or too high before going on to the rest of
the program.  We will also give them another chance to put in their
age correctly.</p>

<p>For our purposes, let's say the age has to be between 5 and 125.
Anything less than 5 we'll count as a mistake (we're assuming toddlers
aren't going to use this program).  Also, anything over 125 will be
counted as too old (assuming the person using the program hasn't
broken the lifespan record by three years).</p>

<p>We can do this with the following program:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if age &lt; 5:
    print("That is too young!  Try again.")
    age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if age &gt; 125:
    print("That is too old!  Try again.")
    age = int(input("What is your age? "))

print("Your age is", age)
</code>
</pre>

<h3>5.6 Booleans Types</h3>
<hr />

<p>Last chapter we talked about <strong>types</strong> in Python.  So
far we have learned about strings, integers and floats.  But when we use if
statements, we are actually using another type!</p>


<p>It is called the <i>boolean</i> type.  Numbers and strings can have many,
many different values, but a boolean can only have 2: True or False.</p>

<!-- TODO add picture/info on boole -->

<p>Boolean values are used to represent truth values: whether something is True
or False.  They are named after English mathematician George Boole who developed a
form of math based on True/False values which became influential in the development
of computers.</p>

<!-- TODO rewrite this sectiopn -->

<p>To make a boolean, we can just assign a variable the values True or False.
For instance, we could set whether we got the guess correct to False like
this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
correct = False
</code>
</pre>


<p>For another example, we can make a variable for whether or not it is
snowing, and assign it the value False:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
snowing = False
</code>
</pre>

<p>We could also make a variable for whether it's raining and give it the value
True:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
raining = True
</code>
</pre>

<p>Booleans are used for keeping track of information like whether certain conditions
have been met, or whether events have occurred.</p>




<h3>5.7 Boolean Operations</h3>

<p>Sometimes we want to <i>combine</i> conditions.  Like if we want to see if
it's a nice temperature, we would need to make sure the temperature is above a
certain point <i>and also</i> below a certain point.</p>

<p>We can do this with the boolean operators.</p>

<p>Booleans can't be added or subtracted, but there are three operators that
work with them.  They are <code>and</code>, <code>or</code> and
<code>not</code>.</p>

<p><code>and</code> takes 2 booleans and tells is if they are <i>both</i> True.
For example, if we want to see if it's raining and snowing, we could use the
following:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
&gt;&gt;&gt; raining = True
&gt;&gt;&gt; snowing = False
&gt;&gt;&gt; raining and snowing
False
</code>
</pre>

<!-- TODO talk more about these -->




<h3>5.8 Using Multiple Conditions</h3>
<hr />

<p>We can thus combine up multiple conditions with these boolean operators.
For example, if we want to see if the temperature is in a nice range, we could
use <code>and</code>:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
temperature = int(input("What is the temperature? "))

if temperature &gt; 50 and temperature &lt; 85:
    print("It's a nice temperature!")
</code>
</pre>

<p>We can combine up as many conditions as we want.  We can also use
parenthesis to group things.  For instance, this rather complicated condition
checks multiple things to decide if it's a nice day or not:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
raining = True
snowing = False
temperature = int(input("What is the temperature? "))

if temperature &gt; 50 and temperature &lt; 85 and not (raining or snowing):
    print("It is a nice day!")
</code>
</pre>




<h3>5.9 Two-Way Decisions</h3>
<hr />

<p>Oftentimes, we want to test a condition and, if it's true, do one thing, and
if it's false, do another thing.  For example, if we want to print whether a
message based on whether it's raining we could do this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
raining = True

if raining:
    print("Bring an umbrella!")

if not raining:
    print("No need for an umbrella.")
</code></pre>

<p>However, because this is so common, there is a simpler way to do this using
the "else" keyword:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
raining = True

if raining:
    print("Bring an umbrella!")
else:
    print("No need for an umbrella.")
</code></pre>

<p>With an if/else statement, if the if condition is true, than the code under
the if line is executed.  Otherwise, the code under the else line is executed
instead.</p>

<p>It can never do <i>both</i> things.</p>



<h3>5.10 Multi-Way Decisions</h3>
<hr />

<p>We can also write if statements with more than 2 options using the "elif"
keyword.  This stands for "else if".  When Python executes a multi-way
decision, it checks each condition in order.  Once it finds one condition that
is true, it executes the statements under it and then goes to the end of the
chain.</p>


<p>For example, we can write a program which will print messages
based on the temperature with three cases like this:</p>


<pre><code class="python">
temperature = int(input("What is the temperature? "))

if temperature &lt; 50:
    print("It's cold!")
elif temperature &lt; 80:
    print("It's medium.")
else:
    print("It's hot!")
</code></pre>

<p>In this program, it will always print exactly one of these messages.
The conditions are checked one by one.  As soon as one is found to be
true, Python will execute the code under it and stop.</p>

<p>For example, if the temperature is 40, then it will find the first
condition to be true and print "It's cold!".  Even though the second
condition is also true, it won't print any other message.</p>

<p>There's no limit to how many <code>elif</code> statements we can
include.</p>
