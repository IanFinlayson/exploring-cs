<h2>5.1 Decisions in Algorithms</h2>
<hr />

<p>So far, our programs have all started on the first line and executed each
line in sequence until the end of the program.  However, many algorithms have
the need to make decisions and do different things under different
conditions.</p>

<p>For example, when we talked about algorithms back in chapter 1, we came up
with the following for guessing a number when the player just answered "yes" or
"no":</p>

<strong>Algorithm 1</strong>
<pre><code class="ini">
1. Set G to 1.
2. Ask if their number is G.
3. If it was, then we are done!
4. If it was not, then add 1 to G.
5. Go back to step 2.
</code></pre>

<p>Here the algorithm needs to make a decision based on the information it has
available to it.  If the guess was right, we do one thing.  Otherwise we do
another.  Lots of algorithms have to do things like this.</p>

<p>Another example is adding numbers.  When you are adding a column of numbers
you have to make a decision on whether to carry or not.  You check if the
column totals more than 9.  If so, you carry the tens place to the next
column.  If not, you don't.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we will talk about how to write Python programs that make
decisions like this.



<h2>5.2 If Statements</h2>
<hr />

<p>The way that we can make decisions like this in Python is with
an <em>if statement</em>.  If statements in Python start with the
word <code>if</code>, followed by some sort of condition, then a
colon.</p>

<p>A <strong>condition</strong> is something that might be either true or
false.  For example, if we read in a number from the user, it might be
bigger than 10, or it might not.  To check this, we could use the following
if statement:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
if number &gt; 10:
</code></pre>

<p>After this line, we put all of the code that we want to happen when
the condition is true.  For example, we can just print a message that
the number is bigger than 10 with a program like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number &gt; 10:
    print("That is bigger than 10.")
</code></pre>

<p>When Python runs this program, it will check if the condition of the number
being bigger than 10 is true or not.  If it is, Python will execute the print
statement.  If the condition is false, that print line will not be executed.</p>

<p>If we run this program and put in a number bigger than, we will see the message
like this:</p>

<pre class="output">
Enter a number: <span class="input">50</span>
That is bigger than 10.
</pre>

<p>However, if we put in something smaller than 10, the program will
<strong>not</strong> run the print message, and we will see nothing:</p>

<pre class="output">
Enter a number: <span class="input">5</span>
</pre>


<h2>5.3 Indentation and Spacing</h2>
<hr />

<p>Notice that the print message in the program above was indented over to the
right.  Sometimes spaces don't matter in Python programs, but here these spaces
before the print are actually really important.  Python uses indentation to
mark if lines are part of an if statement or not.</p>

<p>For example, we can add some more message to the program above, and whether
they are indented or not will determine if they are "part of" the if statement:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number &gt; 10:
    print("That is bigger than 10.")
    print("Good job putting such a big number!")
print("Bye bye!")
</code></pre>

<p>The first two messages, the ones which are indented, will only be executed
when the number is bigger than 10.  However, the message which says "Bye bye!"
will be printed every single time the program runs &mdash; whether the
condition is met or not.  That's because it's not indented, so it's not part
of the if statement.</p>

<p>For this to work, we need to indent our code correctly so Python can tell if
it's part of an if statement or not.  Code should normally not be indented, but
if it's part of an if, it should be. If you mix up indentation, Python will get
confused.  For instance, code like this will not work:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# error, messed up indentation!
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))
if number &gt; 10:
    print("That is bigger than 10.")
  print("In between")
print("Bye bye!")
</code></pre>

<p>Here Python will be confused because it doesn't know what to do with the
second message.  Is it part of the if block or not?</p>



<h2>5.4 Comparisons</h2>
<hr />

<p>In the example above we used the <code>&gt;</code> operator to compare two
numbers and decide which one was bigger.  Of course we can also check if
something is less than something else.  Or if two things are equal or not.
Python uses the following comparison operators:</p>

<table>
<tr><td><code>&lt;</code></td><td>Less than</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&gt;</code></td><td>Greater than</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&lt;=</code></td><td>Less than or equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>&gt;=</code></td><td>Greater than or equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>==</code></td><td>Equal to</td></tr>
<tr><td><code>!=</code></td><td>Not equal to</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> operators will be familiar to
most people from math.  However Python is designed so its easy to type code on
a regular keyboard.  So instead of the &le; &ge; and &ne; symbols, Python uses
<code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>!=</code>.</p>

<p>Also notice that to check if two things are equal, Python uses
<strong>two</strong> equal signs.  That's because a single <code>=</code>
is already used for something: assigning variables.  It's a pretty common
mistake to forget to put the second equal sign in.</p>



<h2>5.5 Example: Checking Input</h2>
<hr />

<p>One common use of if statements is to check if the input users enter makes
sense or not.  For example, if we ask the user their age, they could enter a
value that doesn't make sense like -7, or 3000.  We can use if statements to
write a program which will check if the age given is too low or too high before
going on to the rest of the program.  We will also give them another chance to
put in their age correctly.</p>

<p>For our purposes, let's say the age has to be between 5 and 125.
Anything less than 5 we'll count as a mistake (we're assuming toddlers
aren't going to use this program).  Also, anything over 125 will be
counted as too old (assuming the person using the program hasn't
broken the lifespan record by three years).</p>

<p>We can do this with the following program:</p>

<strong>Program 5.1</strong>
<pre>
<code class="python">
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if age &lt; 5:
    print("That is too young!  Try again.")
    age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if age &gt; 125:
    print("That is too old!  Try again.")
    age = int(input("What is your age? "))

print("Your age is", age)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Because the lines of code which scold the user for entering bad data
are indented under the if line, they will only happen when the conditions
are true.  If the user enters good data, they will never be done.
For example if we put in 20, this happens:</p>

<pre class="output">
What is your age? <span class="input">20</span>
Your age is 20
</pre>

<p>However, if we put in too low of a number, the condition in the first if
statement <em>will</em> be true.  When that happens, the scolding and getting a
new age will happen:</p>

<pre class="output">
What is your age? <span class="input">2</span>
That is too young!  Try again.
What is your age? <span class="input">20</span>
Your age is 20
</pre>

<p>Likewise, if we put in an age which is over 125, the second
if statement will have a true condition:</p>

<pre class="output">
What is your age? <span class="input">750</span>
That is too old!  Try again.
What is your age? <span class="input">75</span>
Your age is 75
</pre>

<p>There's one flaw in this program which is that if you
give a bad answer <em>twice</em>, then it will just accept it.
For example:</p>

<pre class="output">
What is your age? <span class="input">750</span>
That is too old!  Try again.
What is your age? <span class="input">750</span>
Your age is 750
</pre>

<p>In order to fix this, we will need to learn how to repeat some
code over and over again.  That'll be the topic of the next chapter!</p>


<h2>5.6 Booleans Types</h2>
<hr />

<p>Last chapter we talked about <strong>types</strong> in Python.  So
far we have learned about strings, integers and floats.  Last chapter
we saw how these work and how to use them.  But when we use if
statements, we are actually using another type.</p>

<p>It is called the <em>boolean</em> type.  Numbers and strings can have many,
many different values.  In fact there are essentially infinitely many different
values an integer or string can have.  A boolean, on the other hand,
can have only two different values: <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.
Boolean values are used to represent whether conditions are true or not.  A
condition like <code>age &lt; 5</code> has a boolean value.  Either the age is
less than 5 (in which case it's true), or it isn't less than 5 (in which case
it's false).</p>

<p>The somewhat unusual name "boolean", which Python shortens to "bool" comes
from the English mathematician George Boole.  Boole developed a form of math
based on true/false values which became influential in the development of
computers.</p>

<figure>

</figure>

<p>We often use booleans like the programs above.  We do a comparison
which has a true/false value, and put it right into the if statement.
But booleans are normal types which means we can put them into variables
too.</p>

<p>For instance, we can assign a variable to be <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>:</p>

<pre class="output">
&gt;&gt;&gt; done = False
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(done)
&lt;class 'bool'&gt;
</pre>

<p>We could also put the result of a condition into a variable:</p>

<pre class="output">
&gt;&gt;&gt; valid = length &gt;= 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; valid
True
</pre>

<p>Booleans are used for keeping track of information like whether certain
conditions have been met, or whether events have occurred.  We will find uses
for using boolean variables like this next chapter.</p>



<h2>5.7 Boolean Operations</h2>
<hr />

<p>Remember that a type determines what sorts of things you can do with
something.  If you've got a string, you can find the length, or join it
to another string.  If you've got an integer, you can add or subtract it.
If you have a boolean, there are things you can do to it too.</p>

<p>Booleans actually have just three operations:</p>

<ul>
<li>not</li>
<li>and</li>
<li>or</li>
</ul>

<p>The simplest of these is <code>not</code>.  This operator just
reverses the boolean you give it.  If you have a boolean which is
true, then you apply <code>not</code> to it, you get false.  Here's
an example:</p>

<pre class="output">
&gt;&gt;&gt; valid = length &gt;= 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; valid
True
&gt;&gt;&gt; not valid
False
</pre>

<p>If <code>valid</code> is true, then <code>not valid</code> is the opposite
of that: false.</p>

<p>The next operator is <code>and</code>.  This combines two booleans
and tells you if they are <strong>both</strong> true.  For example,
we could use this in an if statement for checking if our age is within
the 5 through 125 range:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if age &gt;= 5 and age &lt;= 125:
    print("Your age is valid.")
</code></pre>

<p>Here we are combining up two boolean values.  The first is the value we get
from <code>age &gt;=5</code>.  This will either be true or false.  The second
is <code>age &lt; 125</code>.  When we combine them with <code>and</code>, we
are going to end up with true if both parts are true.  If either part (or both
parts) are false, then we get false.</p>

<p>The last operator is <code>or</code>.  Like <code>and</code>, it combines up
two booleans and gives you a new one.  Whereas <code>and</code> checks if
<strong>both</strong> sides are true, <code>or</code> checks if
<strong>either</strong> one is.</p>

<p>We could use this to write a program to detect when the age is
<em>invalid</em>:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
age = int(input("What is your age? "))

if age &lt; 5 or age &gt; 125:
    print("Your age is NOT valid.")
</code></pre>

<p>Notice how we use the or to combine up the two cases into one if statement.
Before we had the boolean operators at our disposal, we had to do this with
two separate if statements.  Now, we can combine it into one line.</p>



<h2>5.8 Two-Way Decisions</h2>
<hr />

<p>Oftentimes, we want to test a condition and, if it's true, do one thing, and
if it's false, do another thing.  For example, if we want to write some code
which tells us how to get dressed based on the temperature, we could do something
like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
temp = float(input("What temperature is it out? "))

if temp &lt; 80:
    print("You should wear pants.")

if temp &gt;= 80:
    print("You should wear shorts.")
</code></pre>

<p>This program checks if it's less than 80 degrees and tells the user to wear
pants in that case.  It then checks the opposite: if it's not less than 80 out,
then it must be greater than or equal to 80 degrees.  Here it says to wear
shorts.</p>

<p>It's so common to want to do this, that there is a simpler way, using an
<code>else</code> statement.  That would look like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
temp = float(input("What temperature is it out? "))

if temp &lt; 80:
    print("You should wear pants.")
else:
    print("You should wear shorts.")
</code></pre>

<p>Here, it will check if the temperature is less than 80.  If so, it does
the first print message, telling us to wear pants.  If the condition was false,
then it does the "else" part of the code &mdash; the print which tells
us to wear shorts instead.</p>

<p>With an if/else statement, if the if condition is true, than the code under
the if line is executed.  Otherwise, the code under the else line is executed
instead.  It can never do <em>both</em> things.</p>



<h2>5.9 Multi-Way Decisions</h2>
<hr />

<p>Sometimes we have more than one condition we want to check, and handle each
one differently.  We can do this using Python's <code>elif</code> statement.
This stands for "else if", and allows us to chain together multiple
conditions.</p>

<p>For example, imagine we want to expand our clothing-recommender program
to include cold weather.  We could do it like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
temp = float(input("What temperature is it out? "))

if temp &lt; 60:
    print("Wear a coat.")
elif temp &lt; 80:
    print("You should wear pants.")
else:
    print("You should wear shorts.")
</code></pre>

<p>Here we recommend a coat when it's less than 60 degrees, pants when it's
less than 80, and shorts otherwise.</p>

<p>The way this works is that Python checks each condition in order.  Once it
finds one condition that is true, it executes the statements under it and then
goes to the end of the chain.  This is important because it means <strong>only
one</strong> of the parts will ever run.  For example, in the above program, if
we put in 50, it will do this:</p>

<pre class="output">
What temperature is it out? <span class="input">50</span>
Wear a coat.
</pre>

<p>Here the first condition was true, so it tells us to bring a coat.
Even though the second condition is true as well, it doesn't tell
us to wear pants.  As soon as one case in the chain is true, it stops.</p>

<p>There's no limit to how many <code>elif</code> statements we can
include.  If we want, we can expand it even more:</p>

<strong>Program 5.2</strong>
<pre><code class="python">
temp = float(input("What temperature is it out? "))

if temp &lt; 10:
    print("It's super cold, maybe stay home?")
elif temp &lt; 30:
    print("Wear a snowsuit")
elif temp &lt; 60:
    print("Wear a coat.")
elif temp &lt; 80:
    print("You should wear pants.")
elif temp &lt; 95:
    print("You should wear shorts.")
else:
    print("It's super hot, maybe stay home?")
</code></pre>

<p>It will still only give us one message, no matter what temperature we
put in.</p>

<p>Next chapter we will continue talking about booleans and conditions.
We have seen how they can be used to make decisions with if statements.
Next we will see how they can be used to repeat code over again with
loops.</p>
