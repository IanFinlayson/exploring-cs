<h2>11.1 Installing the PyGame Library</h2>
<hr />

<p>As we talked about in <a href="chapter08">Chapter 8</a>, we can add libraries
to Python that other people have built and incorporate them into our own
programs.  One of these is the <em>PyGame</em> library which allows us to make
graphical programs.  We can use it to make games (hence the name), but it can
also be used for other graphical programs such as simulations, or just having
more colorful output.</p>

<p>To install it with Thonny, choose "Tools -&gt; Manage Packages" from the
main menu.  Then search for "pygame" in the window that comes up:</p>

alt="This screen shows that we searched for 'pygame' in the Thonny package
search window.  The correct package, which is just called 'pygame' is indicated." />

</figure>

<p>The one we want is just called "PyGame", so click on that.  Next click
the Install button:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/pygame2.png"
alt="This screen shows the page for the PyGame package.  There is an install button
which is highlighted." />
<figcaption>The PyGame Package Page</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It will take a moment or two to download.  When it is finished, you should have
PyGame installed and be ready to write and run graphical programs.</p>



<hr />
<h2>11.2 PyGame Basics</h2>

<p>The first thing we need to do is import the PyGame library.
Recall from <a href="chapter08">Chapter 8</a> that this can be
done with the <code>import</code> command:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import pygame
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we need to call the PyGame <code>init()</code> function which sets up
the library, initializing it so we can call upon the other functions:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
pygame.init()
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can create a window.  All of the programs we have written up to this
point have printed their results to the shell window.  The shell is purely
textual, so to draw shapes, images, and other graphical things, we need a
window to put them in.  We can create a window with this line of code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
window = pygame.display.set_mode([800, 600])
</code></pre>

<p>This <code>set_mode</code> function creates the window for us.  Its
parameter is a list containing two numbers.  The first number is how wide the
window should be and the second is how tall it should be.</p>

<p>These numbers refer to <strong>pixels</strong>, which is short for "picture
elements".  All computer screens are made up of tiny lights that can show up as
different colors.  These are called pixels.  Your computer monitor or laptop
screen may have more or less pixels in it.  A pretty typical display these days
might be 1,920 pixels wide and 1,080 pixels tall.  In this case, our 800x600
window takes up around a quarter of the screen.</p>

<p>The window is where all of the things we draw will show up.  Before we can
start talking about drawing things into the window, we need to discuss how
color is represented in computer programs.</p>

<hr />
<h2>11.3 Colors</h2>

<p>Just like everything else in computers, colors are ultimately stored as
numbers.  The way this works is that we have three numbers for every color: one
for the amounts of red, green, and blue in the color<a class="anchor"
id="back1">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note1"
aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>.  Each of these three numbers
ranges from 0 to 255.  The 255 limit may seem random, but that is the largest
number that can fit in one byte.  0 means there is none of that color at all,
and 255 means that color is turned up to the max.</p>

<p>For example, we could make a color with 100 for red, 240 for green and 215
for blue.  This would be a light aquamarine sort of color like this <span style="background-color: #64f0d7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>.
The easiest way to explore colors like this is probably to <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=color+picker" target="_blank">Google "color picker"</a>
and play with Google's built in color choosing tool.  At the bottom left, you will see the label "RGB" which
indicates the three color components.
This will let you find the numbers for any color you want<a
class="anchor" id="back2">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note2"
aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>.
</p>

<p>Colors are put into programs with <em>tuples</em> which are sort of like lists in Python
except they use parentheses instead of square brackets.  The other difference is tuples can't
be changed once they are created, while lists can.  We can assign our aquamarine color into
a variable like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
aqua = (100, 240, 215)
</code></pre>

<p>The numbers are always listed in the order of red, green, and then blue.
Here are some definitions for other common colors:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
red = (255, 0, 0)
green = (0, 255, 0)
blue = (0, 0, 255)

white = (255, 255, 255)
black = (0, 0, 0)
grey = (128, 128, 128)

yellow = (255, 255, 0)
orange = (255, 128, 0)
pink = (255, 0, 255)
purple = (128, 0, 255)
</code></pre>


<hr />
<h2>11.4 Our First Graphical Program</h2>

<p>Now that we can create colors, we can create a complete program using PyGame.
The code for it is given first, then we will discuss it:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import pygame

# setup PyGame
pygame.init()

# create a window
window = pygame.display.set_mode([800, 600])

# set some colors
white = (255, 255, 255)
orange = (255, 128, 0)

while True:
    # fill the window with a white color
    window.fill(white)

    # draw an orange circle in the window
    pygame.draw.circle(window, orange, (400, 300), 100)

    # flip the window
    pygame.display.flip()
</code></pre>

<p>We start by importing the PyGame library, calling the <code>init()</code> function for it,
and creating our window like before.  Next we define two colors for use in the program, a
white for the background and an orange for a circle.  Of course we can change this to be
whatever we want!</p>

<p>The rest of the program takes place in a while loop.  Graphics programs pretty much
always have a main loop in them that keeps the program running.  If we didn't have a loop,
the window would pop up briefly when the program is run and close again when the program
ends.  Here the while loop is an infinite one.  To end this program, you'll have to hit
Thonny's "stop" button.  Ideally, the program would end when the user hits the 'X' to
close the window instead.  We'll see how to do that in a little bit.</p>

<p>Inside the loop, we do three things.  First we fill the window with a white color
by calling <code>.fill()</code> on the window and passing the color we want it filled
with.</p>

<p>Secondly, we draw an orange circle in the middle of the window.  This is done using
<code>pygame.draw.circle()</code> which takes 4 parameters.  The first is what window we
want the circle drawn into.  Next is the color we want the circle to appear as.  After
that we give it the coordinates of where the center of the circle should appear.  We
talk about coordinates in the next section, but (400, 300) is the middle of our
800x600 window.  Finally we pass 100 as the radius of the circle.</p>

<p>The third thing we do inside the loop is to "flip" the display.  PyGame,
like most graphical systems, uses a technique called <strong>page
flipping</strong>.  This means there are actually <em>two</em> graphical areas
we create: the one being shown to the user and the one being drawn on.  When we
draw things like the orange circle, it gets drawn to the "back" display which
isn't visible.  Then when we are done drawing everything, we flip the displays
so the user sees the new scene all at once.  This prevents the user from seeing
a half-drawn scene which won't look right.</p>



<hr />
<h2>11.5 Coordinate Systems</h2>

<p>Before we go much further, we need to talk about the coordinate system used in computer graphics.
What does it mean when we put in (400, 300) for the circle's location?</p>

<p>Graphics systems typically use a coordinate system that is different from
that used by mathematics.  In graphics, the origin, (0, 0) is at the upper left
corner of the window.  The first coordinate, the X coordinate, increases as we
go from left to right.  The second, or Y, coordinate increases as we go from
top to bottom (which is normally the opposite in math).</p>

<p>This image illustrates the coordinate system:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/coords.png"
alt="The upper left corner is the origin (0, 0).  The upper right
corner is at (399, 0).  The lower left corner is at (0, 299).  The
bottom right corner i at (399, 299)." />
<figcaption>The graphics coordinate system</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This image shows the coordinates of each of the four corners of the window.
Notice that, like string indices, we start counting at pixel 0 and not pixel 1.
Here, the window is 400 by 300 pixels large.  That means there are 120,000
pixels.</p>


<hr />
<h2>11.6 Events</h2>

<p>Having to end the program through Thonny is not ideal.  The user should be
able to end the program by clicking the 'X' in the window bar like usual.  To
do this, we need to look for the quit <strong>event</strong>.  An event is just
something that might occur while our program is running, like the user clicking
the close button, pressing a key on the keyboard or clicking the mouse.</p>

<p>By checking for these events, we can make our program respond to what the user
is doing.  PyGame has a function called <code>pygame.event.get()</code> which
returns back a list of all the events that have occurred since the last time we called
it.  We can then loop through this list and respond to the events that we get.</p>

<p>This version of the program checks for the quit event.  It uses a boolean variable
to keep track of whether the program is still running.  When the quit event is encountered,
this variable is set to False.  We also call <code>pygame.quit()</code> at the end
of the program.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import pygame

# setup PyGame
pygame.init()

# create a window
window = pygame.display.set_mode([800, 600])

# set some colors
white = (255, 255, 255)
orange = (255, 128, 0)

running = True
while running:
    # check for events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # fill the window with a white color
    window.fill(white)

    # draw an orange circle in the window
    pygame.draw.circle(window, orange, (400, 300), 100)

    # flip the window
    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
</code></pre>

<p>Now the program should close the window and stop running when the user
clicks the close button on the window bar.</p>


<hr />
<h2>11.7 Keyboard and Motion</h2>

<p>We can get user input from the keyboard or the mouse using this method as well.
To check if a key is pressed, we can detect the <code>KEYDOWN</code> event.  Then
we can check <em>which</em> key was pressed by checking <code>event.key</code>

<p>For example, we could let the user also quit the program by hitting the Escape key.
To do this, we can add an <code>elif</code> to the code checking what type of event was received.
If it was a <code>KEYDOWN</code> event, then we can check which key was pressed.  If it
was Escape, we can also set <code>running</code> to <code>False</code>.  The full list
of keys is <a href="https://www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html">available here</a>.
The code for implementing this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
for event in pygame.event.get():
    # check what type of event it was
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
        running = False
    elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
        # check which key got pressed
        if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
            running = False
</code></pre>

<p>Another thing we can do with this is to let the user move the orange circle around
with the arrow keys.  To do this, we can start by storing the position of the circle
in variables.  That way we can change those variables when the keys are pressed:</p>


<pre><code class="python">
# the position of the circle
x = 400
y = 300
</code></pre>

<p>Then when we draw the circle, we'll use these variables for the position:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
pygame.draw.circle(window, orange, (x, y), 100)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we still need the extra parentheses because the position is passed
as a tuple.  Now if we change the <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> variables, the
change will affect where the circle gets drawn to.  We can do this by adding in code
to change these variables when the arrow keys are pressed.  The full code for this
would look like this:</p>


<pre><code class="python">
import pygame

# setup PyGame
pygame.init()

# create a window
window = pygame.display.set_mode([800, 600])

# set some colors
white = (255, 255, 255)
orange = (255, 128, 0)

# the position of the circle
x = 400
y = 300

running = True
while running:
    # check for events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            # check which key got pressed
            if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                running = False
            elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                y = y - 10
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                y = y + 10
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                x = x - 10
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                x = x + 10

    # fill the window with a white color
    window.fill(white)

    # draw an orange circle in the window
    pygame.draw.circle(window, orange, (x, y), 100)

    # flip the window
    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
</code></pre>

<p>We add or subtract 10 pixels from one of <code>x</code> or <code>y</code> when an arrow
key is pressed.  Note that when up is pressed we subtract 10 pixels.  That's because Y gets
smaller towards the top of the window (which can be confusing at first).</p>

<p>If you were using this approach to keyboard input and movement to make something like a game,
it would not really be ideal.  Rather than have to press they right key over and over to move
the circle to the right, we might like to <em>hold</em> the right key to have it continually move
right.</p>

<p>To do this, we will need to look for both the key pressed and key released events.
When an arrow key is pressed, we can set the circle in motion.  When the arrow key is released
we stop its motion.  To this end, we'll create two new variables for the circle.  One keeps
track of its speed in the x direction and the other is the speed in the y direction.
These start off at 0 to mean the circle isn't moving to start off.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
xspeed = 0
yspeed = 0
</code></pre>

<p>We'll also make a variable for how fast the circle goes when it is moving:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
movementSpeed = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Next we will check for both types of key events (presses and releases) and set the
<code>xspeed</code> and <code>yspeed</code> variables based on that:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# a key was pressed down
elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
    if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
        running = False
    elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
        yspeed = -movementSpeed
    elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
        yspeed = movementSpeed
    elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
        xspeed = -movementSpeed
    elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
        xspeed = movementSpeed

# a key was resleased
elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
    if event.key == pygame.K_UP or event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
        yspeed = 0
    elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT or event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
        xspeed = 0
</code></pre>

<p>When an arrow key is pressed down, we set the <code>xspeed</code>
or <code>yspeed</code> variable to either positive or negative <code>movementSpeed</code>.
Which one depends on which key it was.  For the right arrow key, we want it to move
right so we set <code>xspeed</code> to positive <code>movementSpeed</code> which will
indicate the circle moves up in the X coordinate.</p>

<p>When an arrow key is released, we set the <code>xspeed</code> to 0 when it
was the left or right keys, which stop its side to side movement.  And if the
up or down keys are released it stops moving up or down, so we set the veritcal
<code>yspeed</code> to 0.</p>

<p>Now the only thing to do is to take the speeds and use them to change the position of the
circle.  We can do that with this code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# move the circle
x = x + xspeed
y = y + yspeed
</code></pre>

<p>This adds the speed into each of the two coordinates.  So the way this works is the user
presses an arrow key, let's say the right key.  This sets <code>xspeed</code> to positive 1.
Every time through the loop, the 1 is added into <code>x</code>.  So each time through it moves
1 pixel to the right.  When the user releases the right key, <code>xspeed</code> is set back to 0.
Then the <code>x</code> coordinate will no longer have anything added to it, so the circle stops.</p>

<p>The full code for this example follows:</p>


<pre><code class="python">
import pygame

# setup PyGame
pygame.init()

# create a window
window = pygame.display.set_mode([800, 600])

# set some colors
white = (255, 255, 255)
orange = (255, 128, 0)

# the position of the circle
x = 400
y = 300

# the current speed of the circle
xspeed = 0
yspeed = 0

# how fast the circle can go when moving
movementSpeed = 1

running = True
while running:
    # check for events
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

        # a key was pressed down
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
            if event.key == pygame.K_ESCAPE:
                running = False
            elif event.key == pygame.K_UP:
                yspeed = -movementSpeed
            elif event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                yspeed = movementSpeed
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT:
                xspeed = -movementSpeed
            elif event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                xspeed = movementSpeed

        # a key was resleased
        elif event.type == pygame.KEYUP:
            if event.key == pygame.K_UP or event.key == pygame.K_DOWN:
                yspeed = 0
            elif event.key == pygame.K_LEFT or event.key == pygame.K_RIGHT:
                xspeed = 0

    # move the circle
    x = x + xspeed
    y = y + yspeed

    # fill the window with a white color
    window.fill(white)

    # draw an orange circle in the window
    pygame.draw.circle(window, orange, (x, y), 100)

    # flip the window
    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.quit()
</code></pre>





<hr />
<h2>11.8 Drawing More Things</h2>

<p>Besides just circles, we can draw other shapes as well.  The following program
draws a number of shapes to a window:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import pygame
import math

pygame.init()

window = pygame.display.set_mode([800, 600])

running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            running = False

    # Fill the background with light grey
    window.fill((240, 240, 240))

    # a red rectangle
    pygame.draw.rect(window, (255, 0, 0), pygame.Rect(50, 50, 150, 100))

    # a green ellipse
    pygame.draw.ellipse(window, (0, 255, 0), pygame.Rect(400, 100, 300, 200))

    # a blue polygon
    pygame.draw.polygon(window, (0, 0, 255), [(100, 300), (200, 300), (250, 350), (150, 400), (15, 350)])

    # an orange line
    pygame.draw.line(window, (255, 128, 0), (100, 500), (400, 550), 4)
    
    # a purple arc
    pygame.draw.arc(window, (150, 0, 180), pygame.Rect(500, 400, 100, 100), 0, math.pi/2)
    
    # Flip the display
    pygame.display.flip()

# Done! Time to quit.
pygame.quit()
</code></pre>

<p>The rectangle is drawn with:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
pygame.draw.rect(window, (255, 0, 0), pygame.Rect(50, 50, 150, 100))
</code></pre>

<p>Just like when drawing the circle, the first parameter is the window to draw the
rectangle to and the second is the color it should be.  The third parameter is the
rectangle to draw.  The <code>pygame.Rect</code> function creates a rectangle given
four parameters.  They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>x coordinate</li>
<li>y coordinate</li>
<li>width</li>
<li>height</li>
</ol>

<p>Drawing an ellipse is done in a similar way.  We used this code to draw a green
ellipse:</p>


<pre><code class="python">
pygame.draw.ellipse(window, (0, 255, 0), pygame.Rect(400, 100, 300, 200))
</code></pre>

<p>The parameters here mean the exact same thing.  The only difference is that
the ellipse will be drawn inside the rectangle shape which is given.</p>

<p>Drawing a polygon is done with this line of code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
pygame.draw.polygon(window, (0, 0, 255), [(100, 300), (200, 300), (250, 350), (150, 400), (15, 350)])
</code></pre>

<p>Again the first two things are the window to draw to and the color.  Then the function takes a list
of points which give the coordinates of the points in the polygon.</p>

<p>A straight line can be drawn with code like this:</p>
<pre><code class="python">
pygame.draw.line(window, (255, 128, 0), (100, 500), (400, 550), 4)
</code></pre>

<p>After passing the window and the color for it, we pass two points which give the ending
points for the line.  The last parameter is optional and gives the thickness of the line.</p>

<p>Finally we can draw a curved line, called an arc with:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
pygame.draw.arc(window, (150, 0, 180), pygame.Rect(500, 400, 100, 100), 0, math.pi/2)
</code></pre>

<p>We pass the window and the color first.  Next comes a rectangle which bounds where the arc
will be drawn (just like an ellipse).  The last two parameters are angles measured in radians.
These two angles specify the start and end angle for the arc.</p>




<hr />
<h2>11.9 Drawing Images</h2>

<p>In addition to drawing these shapes, we can also load images from a file and draw them
to the window too.  The first step in doing this is to load the image file from your computer.
We can do this with the <code>pygame.image.load</code> function:</p>


<pre><code class="python">
picture = pygame.image.load("campus.png")
</code></pre>

<p>For this to work, the image file has to be in the same folder as your Python program is
saved to.  PyGame can load several types of images including PNG and JPG.  Once the image
is loaded into a variable, we can draw it using code like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
window.blit(picture, (0, 0))
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of passing the window into a draw method, like for drawing shapes, here we call
<code>blit</code> on the window itself<a
class="anchor" id="back3">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note3"

<li id="note1">In school you learned that red, yellow and blue are the three
primary colors.  That's true in a <em>subtractive</em> model of color, such
as you get when mixing paints together.  But there are other models of color,
such as the <em>additive</em> model wherein you combine colored lights.  In
this model red, green, and blue are the three primary colors.  Shining a red
light and a green light together actually makes a yellow light!

<li id="note2">With this color scheme, there are actually over 16 million colors
we could create.  The human eye can only discern about 10 million different colors.
So while theoretically there's really no limit on the number of colors, we can
practically make any color we can imagine.

<li id="note3">The term "blit" is an old phrase in graphics and
game programming.  Its origin is an acronym for BLock Information Transfer.
To blit something is to transfer it quickly from one part of memory to another.
When you draw an image, you copy the image data onto the screen.
