<h2>11.1 Functions and Objects</h2>

<p>Thus far, when we have made use of things built-in to Python, or in
libraries, we have called <em>functions</em>.  These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>print</li>
<li>len</li>
<li>round</li>
<li>math.sqrt</li>
<li>random.randint</li>
</ul>

<p>A function does some task for us.  Usually we give it some kind of
information, and then it uses that in doing its job.  For example, we can give
the <code>len</code> function a string, and then it tells us how long it is.
With <code>math.sqrt</code>, we give it a number, and it tells us what the
square root is.</p>

<p>There's another way of calling on things built-in to Python, or on
libraries, which is called objects.  An object is a type of variable that
essentially contains functions inside of it.  When you have a regular variable,
like an integer, you can do operations on it (like + and *), and pass it into
functions (like print or round), but it doesn't have any functions of its
own.</p>

<p>An example of an object we have already seen is string variables.  In the
example where we check if a password is valid, we had code that looks like
this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# check each chatacter to see if it's in these categories
for char in password:
    if char.isupper():
        upper = True
    elif char.islower():
        lower = True
    elif char.isdigit():
        digit = True
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax for calling a function on an object is that you put the name of
the object variable first, then a ".", and then the name of the function.  Like
usual, we can pass information inside the parenthesis (but here we don't need
to).  Just like with libraries, the "." means that the thing on the right is
part of the thing on the left.  In this case, these functions are part of the
string object we call them on.</p>

<p>So we are calling these functions<a class="anchor" id="back1">&nbsp;</a><a
href="#note1" aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a> on the string object
called "char".  Objects in Python are just like regular variables, except they
have functions we can call "on them".  The neat thing is that libraries can add
<em>new objects</em>, which essentially allow us to create new sorts of
variables with new operations.</p>

<p>So far, we have only seen 4 types: integers, floats, booleans, and strings.
The graphics library we will be learning today is built with objects.  So it
will allow us to make variables of new types including Point, Line, Circle and
more.  The main idea behind an object is that it's a new sort of variable we
can use, and we use it by calling its functions.</p>


<h2>11.2 Setting up the Graphics Library</h2>
<hr />

<p>When we give Python the command to import the math library, it works because
math comes with Python and the interpreter knows where to find it.  However we
can also use libraries that are developed by others and don't come with
Python.</p>

<p>This can be done lots of different ways.  The simplest way is just to
download the library file and put it in the same folder that our program is in.
The following instructions show how to download and set up the graphics library
we will use:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the library from <a
href="https://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py">this address</a>.  It
is just a regular .py file.  You could read the code if you want, but it uses
many things we haven't gotten to, and is a bit cryptic.</li>

<li>Save the graphics.py file in the same location where you will create a
program.  In order to be able to import the library, Python needs to be able to
find the file.  There are several ways to do this, but the simplest is just to
put it in the same folder where your program will go.</li>

<li>Import the library using the name of the file (without the .py).  So for
the graphics library, we should be able to use <code>import graphics</code>.
If this works, nothing should happen on the import line.  If Python can't find
the library with that name you will get an error message.</li>
</ol>



<h2>11.3 Creating Windows</h2>
<hr />

<p>The first graphic object we'll look at is a window.  A window is a container
for all of the other graphical things we'll see.  We can create a window with
the GraphWin function like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import graphics
window = graphics.GraphWin()
</code></pre>

<p>When you run this program, you should see something like the following:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/window1.png"
alt="The small window is titled 'Graphics Windows'" />
<figcaption>The window that appears</figcaption>
</figure>


<p>The window is an object.  Objects remember things about themselves.  String
objects remember what letters are inside them, and GraphWin objects remember
how big they are, what their titles are and so on.</p>

<p>We can change the title and size of the window by passing them into the
GraphWin function, which the following program does:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import graphics

# set the title, width, and height
window = graphics.GraphWin("My Cool Program!", 800, 600)
</code></pre>

<p>When we run this program, the window that pops up will be bigger.  The
default size is 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall.  The new window will be
800 wide and 600 tall.  We'll talk more about pixels below.  It will also have
our title in the top bar, like this:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/window2.png"
alt="The small window is titled 'Graphics Windows'" />
<figcaption>A larger window, with a customized title</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In addition to remembering things about themselves, objects also have
functions that we can call on them.  One of these for the GraphWin object is
the "close" function.  This function makes the window disappear, just as if you
clicked on the 'X' button to close it yourself.</p>

<p>The following program will close the window after sleeping for 1 second:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import graphics
import time

# make a window
window = graphics.GraphWin("My Cool Program!", 800, 600)

# pause for 1 second
time.sleep(1.0)

# close the window
window.close()
</code></pre>




<h2>11.4 Drawing Points</h2>
<hr />

<p>Just making windows of various sizes, and with various titles is pretty
exciting<a class="anchor" id="back2">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note2"
aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>, but we will want to also actually draw
something inside the window.  The simplest thing that we can draw is a single
point.</p>

<p>The Point represents one pixel in the window.  The term "pixel" stands for
"picture element".  It refers to one tiny dot that forms the graphics display
of your computer screen.  If we make the window 800 pixels wide, and 600 tall,
then there are a total of 800×600 = 480000 pixels inside our window.
We can draw one of them using a Point.</p>

<p>A Point has an x location and a y location which are specified when the
Point object is created.  These control where in the window the point will show
up.  We can create a point that will show up at location (100, 100) with the
following code:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
point1 = graphics.Point(100, 100)
</code></pre>

<p>The point can then be drawn onto our window using the draw function.  This
function takes the window to use for drawing as a parameter.  The program below
creates a window and then draws a single point onto it:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import graphics

# make the window
window = graphics.GraphWin("Point Example", 300, 300)

# make the point
point1 = graphics.Point(150, 150)

# now draw the point onto the window
point1.draw(window)
</code></pre>

<p>The window will now look like this:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/point.png"
alt="The window now has a black point drawn right in the center" />
<figcaption>We now have a point drawn right in the center</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You may have to squint to see it, but there will be a dark colored point
right in the middle of the window.</p>


<h2>11.5 The Coordinate System</h2>
<hr />

<p>I promise we will get to draw things slightly more exciting than points, but
first we need to talk about the coordinate system used in computer graphics.
What does it mean when we pass the 150 in as the point's x location?</p>

<p>Graphics systems typically use a coordinate system that is different from
that used by mathematics.  In graphics, the origin, (0, 0) is at the upper left
corner of the window.  The first coordinate, the X coordinate, increases as we
go from left to right.  The second, or Y, coordinate increases as we go from
top to bottom (which is normally the opposite in math).</p>

<p>This image illustrates the coordinate system:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/coords.png"
alt="The upper left corner is the origin (0, 0).  The upper right
corner is at (399, 0).  The lower left corner is at (0, 299).  The
bottom right corner i at (399, 299)." />
<figcaption>The graphics coordinate system</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This image shows the coordinates of each of the four corners of the window.
Notice that, like string indices, we start counting at pixel 0 and not pixel 1.
Here, the window is 400 by 300 pixels large.  That means there are 120,000
pixels.  Each of these pixels has a color, so next we need to discuss how
colors work.</p>




<h2>11.6 Colors</h2>
<hr />

<p>When we drew the point above, it was drawn in black.  Graphics programs
would look quite boring if we could only use that one color.  So of course we
can change the color of our points.</p>

<p>Colors can be specified in two ways.  The first is as a string with the
color name.  There are hundreds of names that are recognized including "red",
"light blue", "azure" and many others.  A complete list is <a
href="http://www.science.smith.edu/dftwiki/index.php/Tk_Color_Names#List_of_color_names_supported_by_Zelle.27s_graphics.py_library">available
here</a>.</p>

<p>We can use colors to change the background color of our window by calling
the <code>setBackground</code> function.  We can also change the color of our
points by calling the <code>setFill</code> function on the point.  The
following program uses some more interesting colors:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import graphics

# make a purple window
window = graphics.GraphWin("Colors!", 400, 300)
window.setBackground("mediumpurple3")

# one point is orange
p1 = graphics.Point(100, 100)
p1.setFill("darkorange")
p1.draw(window)

# one is sky blue
p2 = graphics.Point(200, 200)
p2.setFill("LightSkyBlue2")
p2.draw(window)

# one is light green
p3 = graphics.Point(300, 150)
p3.setFill("PaleGreen")
p3.draw(window)
</code></pre>

<p>This program looks like this:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/colors.png"
alt="This window has three points of different colors in it" />
<figcaption>Three points in different colors</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While there are lots of colors with names to choose from, we actually are
<em>not</em> limited to that list.  Instead we can choose any color possible<a
class="anchor" id="back3">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note3"
aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>.  As we have discussed, in a computer,
everything is actually stored as numbers.  This includes colors as well.  A
color is actually made of three numbers: one for red, green and blue <a
class="anchor" id="back4">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note4"
aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>.</p>

<p>If there is a specific color we want that is not one of the named colors
that are recognized, we can specify the red, green, and blue components of a
color directly using the <code>color_rgb</code> function.  The red, green and
blue component are numbers ranging from 0 to 255.</p>

<p>The higher a number, the more intense that color will be.  The lower it is,
the less intense.  Imagine that we make a color with 15 for red, 150 for green,
and 230 for blue.  This color will have very little red, a medium amount of
green, and lots of blue.  Altogether it will combine to produce a nice cyan
color.</p>

<p>The following program lets you play around with making colors this way.  It
asks the user for the red, green, and blue components, then makes a color from
them.  Finally, it sets the window's background to this color.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import graphics

# ask for the color components
red = int(input("Red: "))
green = int(input("Green: "))
blue = int(input("Blue: "))

# make a custom color from this
my_color = graphics.color_rgb(red, green, blue)

# make a window with this as the background
window = graphics.GraphWin("Colors!", 400, 300)
window.setBackground(my_color)
</code></pre>

<p>I'd recommend playing with this program a little bit to get a feel for how
the colors work.</p>



<h2>11.7 Circles</h2>
<hr />

<p>Now that we have spent some time learning about the graphics coordinate
system, and about how colors work, we can look at some more types of objects
that can be drawn.  The first one we will handle is Circles.</p>

<p>A circle is created with a center location (which is a Point object), and a
radius.  For example, we can create a circle which is centered at location
(100, 100), and with a radius of 30 pixels like so:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
circle = graphics.Circle(graphics.Point(100, 100), 30)
circle.draw(window)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that, just like points, we have to draw the circle to some window in
order for it to show up somewhere.</p>

<p>A circle also has two different colors associated with it.  One is the
"fill" color, which is the color inside the circle.  The other is the "outline"
color which is the color of the border.</p>

<p>The following program draws a circle to a window:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
import graphics

# make a window
window = graphics.GraphWin("Circles!", 400, 300)
window.setBackground("black")

# make a circle and draw it
circ = graphics.Circle(graphics.Point(200, 150), 50)
circ.setOutline("yellow")
circ.setFill("purple")
circ.draw(window)
</code></pre>

<p>This program will look something like this:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/circle.png"
alt="There is a circle in the middle of the black window.  It's outline is yellow
and it is purple on the inside" />
<figcaption>The circle we drew</figcaption>
</figure>



<h2>11.8 Lines</h2>
<hr />

<p>The next graphical object we will discuss is a line.  A line is created
by connecting two points in the window.  When creating a point, we specify
the two Point objects that serves as the ends.</p>

<p>A line also has a fill color which determines what color the line shows
up as.  The following program creates a couple lines:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *

# make the window
window = GraphWin("Lines!", 400, 300)

# make the two lines
line1 = Line(Point(50, 50), Point(350, 250))
line1.setFill("green")
line1.draw(window)

line2 = Line(Point(50, 250), Point(350, 50))
line2.setFill("red")
line2.draw(window)
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this program uses the <code>from graphics import *</code>
form of the import command in order to avoid having to type "graphics."
each time we use something from the graphics library.  This gets to be a
bit much with the graphics library.  We would need "graphics." three
times to create the Line (one for the line and one for each of the
two points).</p>

<p>This program's output will look like this:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/lines.png"
alt="There are two lines in an 'X' pattern.  One is red and one is green." />
<figcaption>Two lines</figcaption>
</figure>




<h2>11.9 Rectangles</h2>
<hr />

<p>Rectangles can also be created using two points.  Here the two points are
two corners, and the rectangle is created around them.  Line circles, rectangles
have an outline color as well as a fill color.</p>

<p>The following program demonstrates drawing a rectangle.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *

# make the window
window = GraphWin("Rectangle!", 400, 300)

# make a rectangle
r = Rectangle(Point(100, 100), Point(300, 200))
r.setOutline("black")
r.setFill("blue")
r.draw(window)
</code></pre>


<figure>
<img src="images/rect.png"
alt="A blue rectangle with a black outline is in the middle of the window" />
<figcaption>A rectangles</figcaption>
</figure>





<h2>11.10 Movement</h2>
<hr />

<p>We have now seen lots of different shapes and things that we can draw.
These will allow us to create scenes in our window, but anything we draw so far
will just be static, and fixed in place.  If we want to make a game, or
anything else that's interactive, we will need to see how to move these objects
around.</p>

<p>We can do just that by calling an object's <code>move</code> function.  This
takes two parameters.  The first is how much to move it in the x direction, and
the second is how much to move it in the y direction.  These numbers can be
positive or negative.  A negative number given for the first parameter will
move the object <em>left</em>, while passing a positive number will move the
object <em>right</em>.  Likewise, passing a negative number for the second
parameter moves the object <em>up</em> and a positive moves it <em>down</em>
(remember that this is the opposite from math).</p>

<p>We can also move an object horizontally and vertically at the same time.
For instance the following snippet of code will move a circle object 7 pixels
to the left, and 3 pixels down:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
circle.move(-7, 3)
</code></pre>

<p>This function moves the circle all at once.  One moment it was wherever we
put it originally, and the next it's in its new location.  It doesn't gradually
move it.  If we do want to gradually move it (as we often will), we will need
to use a loop to move it little by little.</p>

<p>The following program does this by moving a circle down and to the right little
by little.  The loop keeps calling the move function with a very small amount of
movement, many times.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *

# make the window
window = GraphWin("Moving Ball", 300, 300)

# make a circle
circle = Circle(Point(25, 25), 25)
circle.setFill("blue")
circle.draw(window)

# move the ball 25,000 times
for i in range(25000):
    # by a very small amount each time
    circle.move(.01, .01)
</code></pre>


<p>This program moves a circle from the upper-left corner of the screen to the
lower-right.  It does this by moving the ball by a tiny amount (one
one-hundredth of a pixel), many times.  Notice that we don't have to put
integers into the move function, floats work too.  The larger the numbers, the
faster the ball will move.  If we put 1 in for each, it moves almost too fast
to see.</p>





<h2>11.11 Text</h2>
<hr />

<p>We have two more different things that we can draw in the graphics window.  The
first that we will talk about is text.  This will allow us to write messages onto
the window.  We can't just use the <code>print</code> function for this purpose,
because it sends its text to the shell, not the graphics window.</p>

<p>To make a text object, we pass in a point around which the text is centered,
and the message that it should display.  We can then draw it to the screen.</p>

<p>These objects have several functions for changing their properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>setTextColor</code>: sets the color the text appears in.</li>
<li><code>setSize</code>: sets the point size of the text, which can be between 5 and 36.</li>
<li><code>setStyle</code>: sets the font style to one of "normal", "bold", "italic" or "bold italic".</li>
<li><code>setFace</code>: sets the font face to one of "arial", "courier", "helvetica" or "times roman".</li>
<li><code>setText</code>: sets the message that the text displays.</li>
</ul>

<p>This program creates two messages and sets some of the properties of the two
text objects:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *
import time

# make the window
window = GraphWin("Text example", 500, 300)

# create a text object
text1 = Text(Point(250, 150), "This is BIG message")
text1.setSize(36)
text1.setStyle("bold italic")
text1.setTextColor("red")
text1.setFace("arial")
text1.draw(window)

# make another message
text2 = Text(Point(250, 200), "this is a small one")
text2.setSize(8)
text2.setFace("times roman")
text2.setTextColor("blue")
text2.draw(window)
</code></pre>


<p>And this one produces a result like this:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/text.png"
alt="A large red message saying 'This is a BIG message' appears in the middle of the window.
Just under it is a small blue message saying 'this is a small one'" />
<figcaption>Two Text objects</figcaption>
</figure>





<h2>11.12 Images</h2>
<hr />

<p>The last type of object we will learn to draw is images.
We can use the shapes and colors we have seen so far to draw lots of pretty things, but we can
also use pre-made images in our programs.  This is done using an Image object,
which takes the center of the image as a point, and the name of the file the image is stored in.  The
graphics library supports PPM and GIF images:</p>

<p>The following program creates an image by loading in a file:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *
import time

# make the window
window = GraphWin("Text example", 400, 300)

# load an image
img = Image(Point(200, 150), "umw.gif")
img.draw(window)
</code></pre>

<p>For this to work, you must have a file called <a
href="images/umw.gif">umw.gif</a> in the same directory as the program.</p>

<p>The program then looks like this:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/image.png"
alt="The windows contains a picture of the UMW eagle logo" />
<figcaption>Loading an image</figcaption>
</figure>




<h2>11.13 Mouse Input</h2>
<hr />

<p>So far we have seen how to draw lots of different things including shapes,
text and images.  Making an interactive program or game will require all of
these things, but it will also require user input.</p>

<p>Just like we can't really use <code>print</code> with the graphics library, we
also can't really use the <code>input</code> command either.  We can, but the
input will not come from the graphics window.  It will come from the shell window.
If we want to get user input from the graphics window, we have to use the graphics
library.</p>

<p>We will start with mouse input, and then talk about keyboard input next.</p>
In order to get mouse input, we can use the "getMouse" function of the window
object.  This returns a Point object representing the location in the window
the user clicked.</p>

<p>getMouse actually returns a Point object.  We can then call the Point's getX and
getY function to get the coordinates.</p>

<p>The following program calls getMouse to see where the user clicked, and then
prints the coordinates of the click to the shell:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *

# make a window
window = GraphWin()

# get a mouse click
location = window.getMouse()

# print out the coordinates of the click and close the window
print("Click at (", location.getX(), ",", location.getY(), ")")
window.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this function will pause the whole program until the user clicks
the mouse.  If we want to check if the user has clicked the mouse without
pausing the whole program, we can use the "checkMouse" function instead.  The
next version of this program uses this function.  We now have to call
checkMouse in a loop because it will not wait for the click.  We have to call
it over and over until the use <em>does</em> click somewhere.</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *
window = GraphWin()

while True:
    location = window.checkMouse()
    if location != None:
        print("Click at (", location.getX(), ",", location.getY(), ")")
</code></pre>


<p>If the user has clicked the mouse since the last time either getMouse or
checkMouse were called, then this function returns that point.  Otherwise it
returns "None" which is a Python value meaning no value at all was
produced.</p>





<h2>11.14 Keyboard Input</h2>
<hr />

<p>In addition to mouse input, we can also get keyboard input.  There are two
functions for this: "getKey" and "checkKey".  The first one waits for a key to
be pressed, and the second just checks if one is.  These are analagous to the
"getMouse" and "checkMouse" functions we looked at above.</p>

<p>getKey and checkKey both return a string representing what key was pressed.
This program prints the keys out so that we can see what they are:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
from graphics import *

window = GraphWin("Window", 400, 403)

# tell them to press a key
message = Text(Point(200, 100), "Press a key")
message.setSize(18)
message.draw(window)

while True:
    # wait for a key press
    key = window.getKey()

    # if it was escape, quit the program
    if key == "Escape":
        break

    # print the key to the screen
    message.setText("You pressed '" + key + "'")

window.close()
</code></pre>

<p>We can use this method of keyboard input to write programs that
will respond to user input.</p>


<h2>11.15 Conclusion</h2>
<hr />

<p>This chapter gave you an introduction to the graphics library.  We covered how
coordinates and colors work (which apply to all computer graphics systems).  We
also talked about how to download and set up the library, and talked about
lots of different things you can do with it, including opening windows, drawing
shapes and images, and getting input.</p>

<p>As many things as we discussed, we didn't actually talk about everything that
this library can do.  There are some functions of different objects we didn't cover,
as well as a few whole objects.
A list of all of the objects and function available can be <a
href="http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics/graphics/index.html">found
here</a>.</p>

<p>We also didn't really have any large examples, as this chapter was long enough as
it is.  We will see a few larger programs using the graphics library in coming chapters.</p>

<strong>Chapter Summary</strong>

<ul>
    <li>Python libraries can include functions, which we can call upon to carry out some task.
        They can also contain <em>objects</em> which give us new types of variables to create.</li>
    <li>We can install a new library that don't come with Python by downloading the .py file and placing
        it in the same folder as our program.</li>
    <li>To draw graphics we first need a window to put them in, which can be done with the GraphWin object.</li>
    <li>In computer graphics, the coordinates system has the origin in the upper left-hand corner.
        The X coordinate increases as you go right, and the Y coordinate increases as you go down.</li>
    <li>Colors can be specified by name or by giving the three components of a color: red, green, and blue.</li>
    <li>The graphics library allows us to draw lots of different shaped
        including points, circles, lines and rectangles.</li>
    <li>Strings can be printed to the screen using the Text object, which allows for different
        colors, fonts and sizes.</li>
    <li>Images can be drawn to the screen using an Image object.  The image file has to be in the
        same folder as the program.</li>
    <li>Any of the graphics objects can be moved with the <code>move</code> method.</li>
    <li>We can detect mouse clicks using the GraphWin object's getMouse and checkMouse
        functions.  Both of these return a Point object telling us where the user clicked.
        The difference is that the "get" version waits for the user to click the mouse,
        while the "check" version returns right away.</li>
    <li>Similarly we can detect keyboard presses with the getKey and checkKey functions.
        These return a string which tells us the name of the key pressed.  The "get"
        version waits for a key to be pressed while the "check" version returns immediately.</li>
</ul>

<li id="note1">Sometimes people call functions that are part of an object by
a different name, which is "methods".  I just call them all functions because
I think that name is clearer and they are so similar that I don't think they really
need separate names.  But if you hear the term method, that's what it means:
a function inside an object, like isupper and islower are part of string objects.

<li id="note3">With this color scheme, there are actually over 16 million colors
we could create.  The human eye can only discern about 10 million different colors.
So while theoretically there's really no limit on the number of colors, we can
practically make any color we can imagine.

<li id="note4">In school you learned that red, yellow and blue are the three
primary colors.  That's true in a <em>subtractive</em> model of color, such
as you get when mixing paints together.  But there are other models of color,
such as the <em>additive</em> model wherein you combine colored lights.  In
this model red, green, and blue are the three primary colors.  Shining a red
light and a green light together actually makes a yellow light!
