<h2>7.1 Overview</h2>
<hr />

<p>In the last couple of chapters we looked at if and else statements, and looping.
These statements are examples of <strong>control flow</strong> statements,
because they control the flow of the program &mdash; that is they change
the order the other statements run in.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will look at some more examples of these control flow
statements, and learn some new things we can do with them.  In particular, we
will talk about <em>nesting</em> if and else statements and loops together.
Doing this will allow us to write more complex problems and solve some problems
we couldn't otherwise solve.</p>

<p>With these tools, we can also start to tackle some more interesting
problems.  So this chapter will also talk about some techniques for solving
problems.  Lastly we will look at a handful of example problems, and talk about
how we can go about breaking them down before giving code to solve them.</p>





<h2>7.2 Nesting Control Statements</h2>
<hr />

<p>So far our programs have only used an if and else statement, or a loop at
one time.  But to make more complex programs, we can start to combine them up
together.  We can do that by <em>nesting</em> them together.  For example, we
can put an if/else statement inside of a loop.  Or a loop inside of an if
statement.  Or even a loop inside of another loop.</p>

<p>As a first example, let's look at a program to read numbers from the user
and tell the user if each number is even or odd.  The user would be able to
enter as many numbers as they want, and enter 0 to quit.</p>

<p>To do this, we will need a while loop to keep reading in the numbers.  We
will also need an if/else statement to check if the number is even or not.
The if/else can't be <em>after</em> the loop, because it needs to check every
single number read in.  Instead it has to be <em>inside</em> the loop.</p>

<p>The code for doing this is below:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# read the first number
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

# keep going while it's not 0
while num != 0:
    # do the even/odd check
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Even")
    else:
        print("Odd")

    # get the next number
    num = int(input("Enter next number: "))
</code></pre></li>

<p>The <code>%</code> operator is new, so we need to explain that first.  What this
does is checks the remainder of a division.  For instance if we divide 13 by 5,
we get 2 with a remainder of 3.  So <code>13 % 5</code> is equal to
<code>3</code>.  If the remainder when dividing by 2 is 0, it means there is no
remainder, so the number is even.</p>

<p>Here the if/else is <em>nested</em> inside of the loop.  Every time the loop
is done, we check the if condition and do either the if part or the else part.
Remember that the indentation is what tells us what part of the code is part of
the loop.  Since the if and else statements are indented, they are part of the
loop.  That's what <em>nesting</em> means in computer science &mdash; that
something is part of something else.</p>

<p>There is no restriction on nesting like this.  We could instead put a loop
inside of an if statement, or a loop inside of another loop.  We could even
put a loop inside of an if statement which is part of another loop.  We will
see more examples of nested control structures as we go along.</p>



<h2>7.3 Example: Guess the Number</h2>
<hr />

<p>Now that we know how to nest if statements with loops, we can
finally tackle a Python version of the "Guess the Number" algorithm
we looked at way back in Chapter 1.  The algorithm is given again
in pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code class="ini">
1. Set min to 1.
2. Set max to 100.
3. Set G to (max + min) รท 2 (rounding down if needed).
4. Ask if their number is G.
5. If it is, then we are done!
6. If the guess was too high, set max to (G - 1).
7. If the guess was too low, set min to (G + 1).
8. Go back to step 3.
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we have a loop (steps 3 through 8) with an if/elif/else
statement inside of it (steps 5 through 7).  So our program will need to nest
these statements too.</p>

<p>The Python code to solve this problem is below:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# set initial values for our variables
min = 1
max = 100
done = False

while not done:
    # ask them if this is their number or not
    G = int((max + min) / 2)
    answer = input("Is your number " + str(G) + "? ")

    # respond to their answer
    if answer == "yes":
        done = True
    elif answer == "too low":
        min = G + 1
    elif answer == "too high":
        max = G - 1
    else:
        print("Answers are 'yes', 'too low', or 'too high'.")

# when we exit the loop, we have guessed the number
print("Got it!")
</code></pre>

<p>There are some things to point out about this program.  First, we are using
a boolean variable, called <code>done</code> to keep track of whether or not to exit the
loop.  The variable starts off as False, and we set it to True when we find
the user's number.  Because our condition tells us to keep looping while
we are not done, the loop will keep going until we guess right.</p>

<p>Another thing to point out is that we solve the problem of rounding down by
calling the <code>int</code> function.  We have used this function to change a
string (like "12") into an integer (like 12).  It can also be used to change a
float number (like 12.5) into an integer (like 12).  The <code>round</code>
function could be used to round to the <em>nearest</em> whole number, but not
to always round down like we want here.</p>

<p>We are also calling the <code>str</code> function to convert the variable
G into a string.  The reason for this is that <code>input</code> doesn't
allow us to pass multiple things to be printed like <code>print</code> does.
We have to pass 1 string.  We do this by joining the different parts of
our questions, but we can only join strings with the + operator &mdash; not
integers.  So we use <code>str</code> to convert from a number (like 12)
into a string (like "12").</p>

<p>And crucially the if statement chain for testing if we got our guess
right or not is nested inside the while loop.  You can tell this because
it is indented over.  We need to do this because we need to do the test
for <em>every</em> guess we make, not just one.</p>

<p>Here is an example run of this program:</p>


<pre class="output">
Is your number 50? <span class="input">too high</span>
Is your number 25? <span class="input">too low</span>
Is your number 37? <span class="input">too high</span>
Is your number 31? <span class="input">too low</span>
Is your number 34? <span class="input">yes</span>
Got it!
</pre>


<h2>7.4 Example: Password Strength</h2>
<hr />

<p>Let's look at another example now.  Many websites require user passwords
to meet certain standards.  For example, our university has the following
requirements for passwords:</p>

<ul>
<li>Be at least 8 characters long</li>
<li>Include at least one upper-case letter</li>
<li>Include at least one lower-case letter</li>
<li>Include at least one digit</li>
</ul>

<p>We already know how to check if the string is long enough with
the <code>len</code> function.  The other ones are a bit trickier
though.  The approach we will take is to loop through the entire
password one character at a time.  For each character, we will check
if it is one of the three things we need to look for.</p>

<p>In order to do this, we will need a couple new string methods.
These are <code>isupper</code>, <code>islower</code>, and <code>isdigit</code>.
These each return true if the string contains only upper-case letters, lower-case
letters or digits respectively.  We'll call these on each letter to see what
sort of character it is.</p>

<p>In doing this, we also need to keep track of whether <em>any</em> of the
symbols in the password are in one of these three categories or not.  We will
do this by having a boolean variable for each category.  For instance, we can
have a variable called <code>upper</code> which starts at false.  Then, when we
see an upper-case character, we will set it to true.</p>

<p>The code for solving this problem is given below:</p> 

<pre><code class="python">
# read the password from the user
password = input("Enter password: ")

#  check the length first
if len(password) &lt; 8:
    print("Password must be 8 characters or more.")
else:
    # length OK, now check contents
    upper = False
    lower = False
    digit = False
    
    # check each chatacter to see if it's in these categories
    for char in password:
        if char.isupper():
            upper = True
        elif char.islower():
            lower = True
        elif char.isdigit():
            digit = True
    
    # now check if all three categories are met or not
    if not upper:
        print("Password must contain an upper-case letter.")
    elif not lower:
        print("Password must contain a lower-case letter.")
    elif not digit:
        print("Password must contain a digit.")
    else:
        print("Password is accepted!")
</code></pre>

<p>This is the longest program we have seen so far!  It also has a few nested
statements, so let's go through it carefully so we can be sure to understand
it.  The program starts by reading in your password.  Next it does the check to
see if it is at least 8 characters.  If not, it gives you a message saying it's
not long enough.</p>

<p>The rest of the program is in the <code>else</code> statement.  That
means the rest of the checks only happen when the password <em>is</em>
long enough.  We start by making one variable for each category we have to
check, and setting them all to false.  We will assume we don't have any
of these until we see one.</p>

<p>Next, we loop through every character in the string with a for loop.  For
each character, we check if it's a upper-case letter, lower-case letter or
digit.  In each case we set the corresponding variable to true.</p>

<p>When we are done going through the loop, we will have checked
every single character in the password.  If any of our three boolean
variables is still false, that means that type of thing must not have
been present in the password.</p>

<p>We then finish up by checking those three variables in an if/elif/else
statement.  If any one of them was false, we scold the user saying their
password needed one of those characters.  In the else clause, we know
that their password met all the criteria, so we declare that it is
accepted.</p>


<h2>7.5 Example: Times Tables</h2>
<hr />

<p>Now we will look at an example of nested loops.  That would be one loop
nested inside of another loop.  An example of a problem we could solve with
nested loops is the problem of printing out a times table.  A times table
is a table which shows what one number multiplied by another is.  You
probably had to memorize this table in grade school.</p>

<p>Let's say we want to print a 10 by 10 times table like the following:</p>

<pre class="output">
1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   
2   4   6   8   10  12  14  16  18  20  
3   6   9   12  15  18  21  24  27  30  
4   8   12  16  20  24  28  32  36  40  
5   10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50  
6   12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  60  
7   14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  70  
8   16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  80  
9   18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81  90  
</pre>

<p>To do this, we will need two nested loops.  The first loop will loop
through each of the ten <em>rows</em> of the table.  Then the inner
loop will go through each of the ten <em>columns</em> of the table.
Then in that loop we print one number.  The basic algorithm would look
like this:</p>

<pre><code class="ini">
for each row:
    for each column:
        print this row number times this column number
</code></pre>

<p>Because the column loop is nested inside the row loop, it will be done
in its entirety for every row.  With ten rows and ten columns, we will get
a total of 100 numbers printed out.</p>

<p>The Python code for this program is below:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
# read the size of the table
size = int(input("What size table would you like? "))

# loop through each row
for row in range(1, size + 1):
    # loop through each column
    for col in range(1, size + 1):
        # print one 'cell' of the table
        print(row * col, end="\t")
    # go to the next line after this row is done
    print()
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple things to notice here.  First, we have our nested loops.
Each loop goes through the numbers 1 to 10.  We also have to give them a
different variable (<code>row</code> and <code>col</code> in this case).  We
couldn't use "i" for both because then one would overwrite the other.</p>

<p>Also we pass <code>size + 1</code> as the end point to the <code>range</code>
function.  That allows us to loop more or less depending on how big of a table
the user requested.</p>

<p>The print that outputs the number uses the two variables <code>row</code>
and <code>col</code> multiplied together.  We don't want each number to be on a
line all by itself, so we have to tell Python not to end with a new line.
Instead we pass <code>end="\t"</code>.  The <code>"\t"</code> is a <em>tab
character</em>.  By putting a tab after each character, we make sure the
numbers line up nicely in columns.  We could have used a space and it would
have worked, just looked a little messier.</p>

<p>Then we have the funky looking line that calls <code>print()</code> with
nothing at all between the parenthesis.  The purpose of this is to go down to
the next line.  Each time we print a number, we end with a tab.  Then after one
row is done (after the inner for loop has finished), we need to go down to the
next line so the next row has room.  That's what that second print
accomplishes.</p>

<p>Nested loops can be tricky because you have to keep track of where you are
in both at the same time.</p>



<h2>7.6 Breaking Down Problems</h2>
<hr />

<p>As we mentioned in Chapter 1, computer science is not really the study of
computers &mdash; it is the study of algorithms.  The main thing that computer
scientists do is come up with algorithms to solve various problems.  Usually
they write the algorithms in a programming language like Python, but coming
up with the algorithm in the first place is usually the hard part.</p>

<p>Like any intellectual skill, learning to develop algorithms is something
that takes a bunch of time and practice.  That said, there are some techniques
for breaking down a problem so that you can go about solving it.  This section
will give some advice for doing this.</p>

<p>The following are steps that I think are good to go through when tackling a
new problem:</p>

<ol>

<li><p><strong>Identify the inputs</strong></p> <p>Most problems have some kind
of information which is given to you as input.  Your algorithm is generally
going to have to use this input in some way, so listing out what inputs you
will need is a good starting point.</p></li>


<li><p><strong>Identify the outputs</strong></p>
<p>For most problems, there is also some kind of solution that you are looking
for.  If we don't have the output we are looking for firmly in mind, it will be
hard to hit upon the right algorithm.  Listing the outputs our algorithm is
expected to produce will make sure we know our goal.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Solve a few examples by hand</strong></p>

<p>Next you should solve a few examples of the problem just by hand.  If you
can't solve the problem with example inputs, then you have no hope of coming up
with an algorithm that can solve it in general.  When doing this, it's good to
try examples of the different situations that could arise.</p>

<p>By working through a few concrete examples, you are doing two things.  First
you are making sure that you really understand the problem before diving into
an algorithm.  Secondly, you are going through the steps that your algorithm
will need to go through which will give you insight into writing it.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Write the basic steps</strong></p>

<p>Based on what you learned working the example problems, you can now sketch
out the algorithm.  But rather than jump right into Python code, it's often
helpful to start with righting down the basic steps in English first.</p>

<p>The main reason for this is because it's easier to focus on just the
algorithm and not the details of a programming language.  For example, you
don't need to worry about deciding whether things should be int or float,
or making sure parenthesis line up right.</p>

<p>This English like description of an algorithm is sometimes called
"pseudocode" because it is sort of like computer code, but not really in any
actual language.  The main benefit of this is that it lets us focus on
the algorithm without being distracted by details of Python syntax.</p>

<li><p><strong>Test the steps</strong></p>

<p>Another benefit of using pseudocode is that we can now test out the algorithm
in its simple English-like steps before coding it.  We should follow the
steps a couple of times to make sure that it gets the right answers.  If
we made any mistakes, or if it is wrong in some cases, we can fix it before
we spend the time making it a program.  Algorithms in pseudocode can be
easier to fix than programs in a full programming language.</p></li>


<li><p><strong>Write the actual code</strong></p>

<p>Once we are confident our basic algorithm is working, we can start putting
it into actual code in a programming language (we'll use Python of course).
Now instead of focusing on the problem itself, we will focus on the language's
syntax and finding all the functions we need.</p></li>


<li><p><strong>Test the code</strong></p>

<p>Now we can test our code out to see if it gives us the answers that we
expect.  We should be able to plug in the inputs for the examples we solved
by hand and get the right answers.</p>

<p>Another benefit of splitting our problem-solving steps into two parts
is that we should not have to fix problems with the actual algorithm any
more (those should have been caught in step 5).  Any problems now should
be with translating our pseudocode steps into actual Python code.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Experienced programmers will often skip steps 4 and 5, and jump right into
writing code when they have an idea of how to solve a problem.  The main reason
for this is that they are so comfortable with the programming language they are
using.  An experienced programmer can translate steps into code as they go.
For a beginner this is harder.  And even experienced programmers will often
fall back to writing the steps in English first when they run into an
especially tricky problem<a class="anchor" id="back1">&nbsp;</a><a
href="#note1" aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>.



<h2>7.7 Breaking Down Problems Example</h2>
<hr />

<p>As an example of applying these steps, let's solve the problem of figuring
out how much somebody is paid given their hourly rate and the number of hours
they worked.  If the hours worked are over 40, then the person is paid "time
and a half" for their overtime.</p>

<p>It's worth pointing out that the problem of solving one specific case of
this problem (like if you worked 30 hours and make 12 dollars per hour) is just
a math problem.  It becomes a computer science problem when we want to solve it
<em>in general</em>.  With the right algorithm, we could solve any case of this
problem at all &mdash; no matter what the inputs are, our algorithm will give
us the right answer.</p>

<p>Let's go through the steps outlined above:</p>


<ol>

<li><p><strong>Identify the inputs</strong></p>

<p>For this problem we have two pieces of input: the hourly rate and the number
of hours worked.</p>

<li><p><strong>Identify the outputs</strong></p>

<p>In this case, we only want one output, which is the amount of money
earned.</p>

<li><p><strong>Solve a few examples by hand</strong></p>

<p>For this problem, we should solve an example where the person doesn't get
overtime and one where they do.  Let's start with the case where they
don't get overtime.  Say they work for 30 hours, and make 12 dollars
per hour.  In this case, we should just multiply the two numbers together
to get 30ร12 = 360.</p>

<p>In the case where the employee <em>does</em> get overtime, we have to
do something extra.  Let's say they work 45 hours and make 10 dollars per
hour.  Now we need to give them 10 dollars for each of the 40 regular
hours they are working.  We also need to pay them extra for the hours
they work over 40.  In this case that's 5 hours at 15 dollars per hour.
So in total we have 40ร10 + 5ร15 = 475.</p>

<li><p><strong>Write the basic steps</strong></p>

<p>We should use the steps we took solving the problem above to guide us in
writing them out in pseudocode.  We will have identified the two main cases in
this problem, and might come up with something as straightforward as the
following:</p>

<pre><code class="ini">
1. Read in the hours
2. Read in the wage
3. If they worked 40 hours or less, pay will be (hours * wage)
4. Otherwise, pay will be:
     40 * wage +  (hours - 40) * (wage * 1.5)
5. Print out the pay
</code></pre>


<li><p><strong>Test the steps</strong></p>

<p>In this case, we can run through these steps with a couple of example inputs
to make sure they work.  We can even use the ones we worked through by hand to
make sure they get the same answer we arrived at.</p>

<p>If something does go wrong here, we should modify the algorithm at this
point before moving on.</p>

<li><p><strong>Write the actual code</strong></p>

<p>Now that we have an algorithm that we are pretty confident with, we can
go through and translate it into Python code.  In this case, we can write
something like this:</p>

<pre><code class="python">
hours = float(input("How many hours did you work? "))
wage = float(input("What is your hourly wage? "))

if hours &lt;= 40:
    pay = hours * wage
else:
    pay = 40 * wage +  (hours - 40) * (wage * 1.5)

print("Your pay will be", pay)
</code></pre>

<li><p><strong>Test the code</strong></p>

<p>Finally we can test this code to make sure the results it gives matches
what we expect.  We should be able to run this code and give it the inputs
we tested in step 3 to make sure it gets the same result that we got.</p></ol>

<p>Because this problem isn't <em>terribly</em> difficult, many of you
could probably have jumped straight into code.  The point of this section
is to give an example of solving problems this way.  These steps will be
helpful to at least think about when you encounter trickier problems.</p>





<h2>7.8 Flowcharts</h2>
<hr />

<p>Another tool that computer scientists use to solve problems before jumping
into code is the flowchart.  A flowchart shows the steps of an algorithm, just
like pseudocode does.  A flowchart however makes the decisions in the algorithm
really clear by having arrows that show what steps happen when.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a flowchart for the overtime program:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/flow1.png"
alt="A flowchart showing the algorithm given above graphically.  Each box
contains one step of the algorithm.  The boxes move one to the next to show
the sequence of steps." />
<figcaption>A flowchart showing the steps in the pay calculator algorithm.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The flowchart shows the algorithm in a slightly more graphical way.  Each
box in the chart displays one step of the algorithm.  The nice thing about a
flowchart is that it makes the control flow statements really clear.  In this
case, you can see the decision (which is typically shown with a diamond shape
in a flowchart), with branches for the "yes" and "no" cases.</p>

<p>Flowcharts also make loops easy to spot.  We can make a flowchart for the 
problem of reading a valid age from the user.  The steps in the following
algorithm keep asking the user for an age until they put in something that's
not negative:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/flow2.png"
alt="This flowchart shows the steps of reading a valid age.  You can see the loop
because there is an arrow pointing back to a previous step." />
<figcaption>A flowchart showing the steps of reading a valid age from the user.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>You can see the loop in this algorithm because of the arrow that's pointing
back to a previous step (that's the arrow pointing from the "Read age again"
step back around to the decision).  Making flowcharts can be helpful as you are
working on an algorithm, as they can help you understand the order that
the steps need to be done in.</p>

<ul>

    <li>These control flow statements can be combined, or nested,

<li id="note1">When I personally am writing programs, I will often start by
writing my "basic steps" as comments in my program files.  Then I read through

this method works well.  <a href="#back1" aria-label="Back to
