<h2>4.1 What are Types?</h2>
<hr />

<p>Just like us, programs need to keep track of information as they are solving
problems or making decisions. They do this by storing data inside of variables.
Last chapter, we saw how to create variables and also how to read them from the
user and print them to the screen.  We actually saw how to do this with only
one type of data.</p>

<p>Python actually provides multiple types of data.  A <strong>type</strong> is
something associated with a variable that determines what sorts of things you
can do with it.  To use a variable, you need to know what type it has.</p>

<p>For example, you probably have a first name like "Anne", and a last name,
like "Smith".  In Python, these are called <em>strings</em>.  You can do some
things with strings like join them together, to get "Anne Smith".  Or see how
many letters they have.  Other things don't make sense to do with strings.  For
example, you can't subtract strings &mdash; that just doesn't make any sense.</p>

<p>You also have a birth year, like 1998.  You can do different things with
that piece of information.  For example, you <em>can</em> subtract it from
other numbers.  We can subtract 1998 from the current year to see how old you
are.</p>

<p>Python has several different types for dealing with different kinds of
information like this.  In this chapter, we will look at strings and numbers.
We will also talk about some of the operations we can do with these.</p>





<h2>4.2 Strings</h2>
<hr />

<p>The first type that we will look into is the <i>string</i> type.  A string
is some text inside of a program.  For instance a message, name, address,
email, password, URL etc. are all textual and would be stored as strings in a
Python program.</p>

<p>Strings can be created by enclosing text inside of double quotes:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
name = "Anne Smith"
print(name)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Strings can actually be enclosed inside of single quotes instead:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
name = 'Anne Smith'
print(name)
</code>
</pre>

<p>There is usually no difference between the two ways of making strings.
The exception is when a string <i>contains</i> a quote.
For example, this program is just not going to work:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
answer = input("Answer "yes" or "no" here ")
print(answer)
</code>
</pre>

<p>The problem here (which you can see from the way the code is highlighted) is
that when Python sees the " at the start of "yes", it thinks that the string is
over.  Then it gets really confused because it can't figure out what to do with
the yes.  To fix this, we can use single quotes instead:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
answer = input('Answer "yes" or "no" here ')
print(answer)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now this is OK because Python knows that the string is not over until it
sees the second ' symbol.  This goes the other way too.  For example this
program has an error:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
print('You can't enter a negative number!')
</code>
</pre>

<p>But this one is fine:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
print("You can't enter a negative number!")
</code>
</pre>


<h2>4.3 Joining Strings</h2>
<hr />

<p>Next we will talk about some of the operations that you can do with
strings.  The first one we will talk about is joining strings, which
is also sometimes called concatenating<a class="anchor" id="back1">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note1" aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>.</p>

<p>This is done by putting two existing strings together
with a + in between them.  For example, the following
program asks the user for their first and last name, and then joins them
together to form a full name:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# read the names from the user
first = input("What is your first name? ")
last = input("What is your last name? ")

# join them together in a new variable
fullName = first + last

print(fullName)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Below is an example of this program being run:</p>

<pre class="output">
What is your first name? <span class="input">Anne</span>
What is your last name? <span class="input">Smith</span>
AnneSmith
</pre>

<p>This program has three variables, which are all strings.  The first contains
the input the user gave for the first name ("Anne" in this example), the second
contains the last name ("Smith"), and the third is created by joining the two
names ("AnneSmith"), which is then printed out.</p>

<p>We can add as many strings together as we want.  For example, we can make it
so there is a space between the users first and last name by joining a space in
between like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# join them together in a new variable, with a space
fullName = first + " " + last
</code>
</pre>



<h2>4.4 String Length and Indexing</h2>
<hr />


<p>A string is a sequence of one or more <i>characters</i>.  A character is
just a single symbol of text, such as a letter, numeral, punctuation or space.
For instance, the string string "Hello World!" has 12 characters: 10 letters, a
space, and an exclamation mark.</p>

<p>We can get the length of a string by using the <code>len</code> command.
The following program will get a string from the user and then print how
long it is:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# program to print the length of the user's input
response = input("Enter a string: ")
length = len(response)
print("That string has", length, "characters.")
</code>
</pre>

<p>Below is an example run of this program:</p>

<pre class="output">
Enter a string: <span class="input">Hello out there!!</span>
That string has 17 characters.
</pre>

<p>We can also get any individual characters out of a string if we
want to.  Each character in a string has an <i>index</i>.  The index starts
at 0 and goes up by 1 for each character.  For instance, the string "Hello"
has these indices:</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/string-index.png"
alt="H is index 0, e is index 1, the first l is index 2, the second l is index 3,
and the o is index 4"/>
<figcaption>The indices of a string</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Notice that, while there are 5 letters, the indices go from 0 to 4, and that
5 is not the index of any letter.  To get just one character from a string, we
put the name of the string, then the index we want inside of square
brackets.</p>

<p>For example, we can write a program that prints out the first letter of our
input like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# program to print just the first letter of the user's input
response = input("Enter a string: ")
first = response[0]
print(first)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Here is an example of this program running:</p>

<pre class="output">
Enter a string: <span class="input">Hello out there!!</span>
H
</pre>

<p>This may not seem terribly useful, but getting the characters out of a
string is sometimes necessary.  For example, if a string has several things in
it, like a first name and a last name, you may need to look at each character
to see where the first name ends and the last name begins.</p>



<h2>4.5 Numbers</h2>
<hr />

<p>Many programs work with numerical data, so numbers are another important
type in Python.  As we will see, numbers come up a lot more in programming than
you might think.  Even things like games need lots of numbers to work.  For
example, the positions of everything on the screen are stored as numbers.</p>

<p>Python actually has a few different types of numbers for different
situations.</p>

<p>The first is the integer, or int type.  Integers are numbers that have no
fractional component.  For example, an int can be equal to 3, or 4, but not 3.5.
Integers can be positive or negative.  Some languages have limits on how big an
integer can be, but Python allows integers to be as big as they need to
be<a class="anchor" id="back2">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note2" aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>.


<p>We can create an integer just by putting a number into a program.  We can
also assign it to a variable to keep track of it.  For example, to create a
variable to keep track of the year someone was born, we could do so like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
birthYear = 1998
</code>
</pre>

<p>Integers cannot have any fractional component.  So if we make a number that
does have a fraction in it, Python gives it a different type, called a
<em>float</em><a class="anchor" id="back3">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note3" aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
size = 10.2
</code>
</pre>

<p>We can check on the type of something in Python by using the <code>type</code>
command.  For example, we could use the shell window to check the types of the two
numbers we created above:</p>

<pre class="output">
&gt;&gt;&gt; birthYear = 1998
&gt;&gt;&gt; size = 10.2
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(birthYear)
&lt;class 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(size)
&lt;class 'float'&gt;
</pre>


<p>A float is a number which can have a fractional part.  That fractional part
might be 0 though.  For example, if you make a variable equal to 3.0, then it
will be stored as a float, which just happens to have the fractional part equal
to 0.</p>

<p>You may wonder why not just have all numbers be floats, since they can have
fractional parts, but also can be set to numbers without a fractional part.
The reason is that floats don't store numbers exactly, they only store
approximations of them.  The reason for this is that some numbers, like Pi, would
require infinite memory to store exactly.</p>

<p>We can see this effect by giving Python certain computations like the
following:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
&gt;&gt;&gt; 0.1 + 0.2
0.30000000000000004
</code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that the answer should really be 0.3, but Python gives us a number that
is almost, but not exactly, 0.3.  This might seem like a flaw in Python, but it
just comes from the fact that there are infinitely many real numbers between 0
and 1 &mdash; we can't store them all perfectly, that's just life.</p>


<p>As a rule of thumb, you should use integers when a number won't have a
fractional component, because integers are exact.  When a number might have a
fraction, you just have to use a float.</p>


<h2>4.6 Number Input</h2>
<hr />

<p>To read in a float from the user, we can't just use the <code>input</code>
command.  This always gives us a string, even if the user types in a number.
You can see this in the following shell example, where we read in a variable
and then check its type:</p>

<pre class="output">
&gt;&gt;&gt; num = input("Enter a number ")
Enter a number <strong>7</strong>
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(num)
&lt;class 'str'&gt;
</pre>

<p>This is probably confusing, because 7 obviously <em>is</em> a number.  But
strings can contain digits too.  For instance, if you are reading in an
address, it might be something like "1301 College Avenue".  So strings can
contain numbers inside of them.  This one just happens to contain only a number.
Python doesn't automatically set the type based on what the user types in.</p>

<p>Now because it's a string, we can't really use it like a number.  For example,
if we try to add this variable to another number, we will get an error.</p>

<p>In order to actually get a number from the user, we need to convert
it into either an int or float first.  This can be done by putting either <code>int()</code> or
<code>float()</code> around the input line, like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
num1 = int(input("Enter an integer "))
num2 = float(input("Enter a float "))
</code>
</pre>

<p>The first example will read in the user's input and convert it to an
integer.  The second will convert it into a float.  If the user puts in
something that is not correct, the program will stop with an error.  For
example, if we put in "3.5" for the first line, or "banana" for either
line, the program won't continue.</p>

<p>We'll learn how to catch these sorts of errors and handle them later on.</p>



<h2>4.7 Doing Math</h2>
<hr />


<p>Once we have numbers inside a Python program, there are lots of things
we can do with them.  We saw that + can be used to join together strings.
With numbers it adds them together.  For example, the following program
reads two float numbers from the user and then adds them together,
displaying the result:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# this program adds two numbers given by the user
num1 = float(input("Enter a number: "))
num2 = float(input("Enter a number: "))
total = num1 + num2
print("The total is", total)
</code>
</pre>

<p>This program reads in the two numbers from the user, and stores them in
variables called "num1" and "num2".  It then adds them together using the +
operation.  Because these are numbers, this results in getting the sum of the
two.  This is why types are important &mdash; if they were strings it would
have joined them.  The result of the addition is stored in the variable called
"total" which is then printed to the screen.</p>

<p>Of course Python has other operations besides just addition.  Below is a list
of some operators that Python supports:</p>

<table>
<tr><th>Operator</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>+</td><td>Addition</td></tr>
<tr><td>-</td><td>Subtraction</td></tr>
<tr><td>*</td><td>Multiplication</td></tr>
<tr><td>/</td><td>Division</td></tr>
<tr><td>**</td><td>Exponentiation</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Using the + and - symbols for addition and subtraction
is probably pretty familiar to you.  Some of the others might take a
little while to get used to.</p>

<p>Programming languages were made with standard American keyboards in mind, so
the symbol for multiplication is the asterisk (*) instead of × or · symbols
used more in math.  Likewise we use the / symbol for division instead of the ÷
symbol.  The symbols were picked to make them easier to type when writing
code.</p>

<p>Notice that exponents are done with two asterisks <code>**</code>.  A fairly
common mistake is to use the caret symbol ^ instead.  This could have been used,
but actually means something else in Python<a class="anchor" id="back4">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note4" aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>.</p>

<p>Python follows the standard mathematical rules of precedence which can be
overridden with parenthesis.</p>





<h2>4.8 Example: Tips</h2>
<hr />

<p>As an example of working with numbers, let's write a program that can figure
the amount that you should tip a server at a restaurant.  When the bill comes at
a restaurant, it's expected that diners will give a tip between 15 and 20 percent
of the price of the meal.  This can sometimes be tricky to figure out<a class="anchor" id="back5">&nbsp;</a><a href="#note5" aria-describedby="footnote-label"></a>,
so let's write a program to figure it out for us!</p>

<p>The program should start off by asking the user how much their meal cost.
To do that, we will need to use the <code>input</code> combined with the <code>float</code>
command to read in a number that may have a fractional part:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))
</code>
</pre>

<p>Next, we need to do a little math.  If the user wants to give a 15% tip, then we
should multiply the amount by 1.15.  This will give a new number which is equal to
the original amount, but is 15% more.  We should save this number into a new variable:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
total = cost * 1.15
</code>
</pre>

<p>One mistake beginning programmers sometimes make is to not put the answer to
something like this in a variable.  For instance they might write a line like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# wrong
cost * 1.15
</code>
</pre>

<p>This line of code doesn't really do anything.  It multiplies cost by 1.15, but it
doesn't do anything with the answer.  In order to make use of a result like this, we
have to put it into a variable.</p>

<p>Now that we have the amount with a tip added in, we can print it for the user:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
print("The amount with tip is", total)
</code>
</pre>

<p>This will print out the full amount with tip added in, which we have just calculated.
The whole program with comments added is below:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# read in the starting cost
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))

# figure out the cost with a 15% tip added
total = cost * 1.15

# print the result
print("The amount with 15% tip is", total)
</code>
</pre>

<p>Below is an example of running this program:</p>

<pre class="output">
How much was the bill? <span class="input">32.40</span>
The amount with 15% tip is 37.26
</pre>


<h2>4.9 Variable Tip</h2>
<hr />

<p>This program would be quite helpful in figuring out how
much to tip a server, but we can make it even better.  What
if someone wants to tip 20% instead?  We could of course just
change the "1.15" in the program to "1.20" instead.</p>

<p>But it would be even better if we asked the user how much they
want to tip and then use that amount instead of a pre-determined
amount.</p>

<p>To start we will ask them <strong>two</strong> questions instead
of just one:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# read in the starting cost and tip amount
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))
percentage = int(input("How much do you want to tip? "))
</code>
</pre>

<p>Now we have two variables.  The first one (<code>cost</code>) will
store the cost of the meal before tipping.  The second one
(<code>percentage</code>) will store the percentage the user wants
to tip.</p>

<p>Now we need to do a little bit of math.  The first thing we need
to do is to divide the percentage they entered by 100.  That way we
can go from "15" to the ".15" that we need.  (The word
"percent" actually means divided by 100).</p>

<p>Next we need to add 1 to this number.  That way we go from the
.15 to the 1.15 we used in the first program.  Except now it will work
with any percentage.</p>

<p>Then we can multiply that number by the cost of the meal.  Altogether,
that gives us this line of code:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
total = cost * (1 + percentage/100) 
</code>
</pre>

<p>Notice that we used parenthesis to make sure to do the addition before the
multiplication.  The new and improved version of the program is below:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# read in the starting cost and tip amount
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))
percentage = int(input("How much do you want to tip? "))

# figure out the cost with the tip added in
total = cost * (1 + percentage/100)

# print the result
print("The amount with tip is", total)
</code>
</pre>

<p>And here is an example of running it:</p>

<pre class="output">
How much was the bill? <span class="input">41.40</span>
How much do you want to tip? <span class="input">20</span>
The amount with tip is 49.68
</pre>







<h2>4.10 Rounding</h2>
<hr />

<p>One last thing before we close out this chapter.  I sort of carefully
chose the inputs to the last program so that it looked right.  If I picked
other things, it would not look as nice.  For example:</p>

<pre class="output">
How much was the bill? <span class="input">37.21</span>
How much do you want to tip? <span class="input">17</span>
The amount with tip is 43.5357
</pre>

<p>That just looks weird when we are talking about money.  We always round
money to the nearest cent.  We would not expect to see something like this,
so let's talk about how to fix it.</p>


<p>The best way is to round the result to 2 decimal places.  This is done with
the <code>round</code> command, which takes the number we want to round and how
many decimal places to round to.  We can try this in the shell</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
&gt;&gt;&gt; round(43.5357, 2)
43.54
</code>
</pre>

<p><code>round</code> always rounds to the <i>nearest</i> place.  For instance
<code>round(4.7, 0)</code> rounds up to 5, while <code>round(4.3, 0)</code>
will round down to 4.</p>

<p>The program with this fix in place would look like this:</p>

<pre>
<code class="python">
# read in the starting cost and tip amount
cost = float(input("How much was the bill? "))
percentage = int(input("How much do you want to tip? "))

# figure out the cost with the tip added in
total = cost * (1 + percentage/100)

# round the answer to 2 decimal places
rounded = round(total, 2)

# print the result
print("The amount with tip is", rounded)
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is a pretty advanced program!  It takes two pieces of input, uses four
variables, and does some sort of tricky math.  It even makes sure that the
output looks like the user would expect.  Even better it actually solves
a real-life problem most of us can appreciate.  If you followed what we have done
here, then great job!</p>

<p>Next chapter we will look at programs that do different things in different
scenarios.</p>
